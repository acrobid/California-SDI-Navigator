# Required Documentation

A complete, accurate claim with proper documentation processes faster. Here's everything you need.

## Core Required Information

Have this information ready before you start your online application:

### 1. Personal Details
- Full Name (as it appears on your SSN card)
- Social Security Number
- Date of Birth
- Driver's License or ID card number
- Email address & Phone number
- Mailing Address (Crucial for receiving your benefit debit card)

### 2. Employment Information
- **Last Employer**: Federal Express Corporation
- **Employer Address**: 3610 Hacks Cross Road, Memphis, TN 38125
- **Last Day Worked**: The date of your last flight or duty period
- **Employment Status**: Still employed (if on leave)
- **Reason for Not Working**: Medical/Disability
- **Compensation**: Be prepared to report any sick pay, vacation pay, or other income received after your last day worked.

### 3. Medical Information
- Treating Physician's Name
- Physician's Mailing Address
- Physician's Phone & Fax number
- **Physician's Medical License Number**
- Date the disability began
- General nature of your disability

## The Physician Certification (Critical Step)

The most common cause of claim delays is the lack of medical certification (Part B). Your claim is **not complete** until your doctor submits this.

### How to Ensure it Happens:
1. **Online (Preferred)**: After you file Part A, you will receive a **Claim Receipt Number**. Provide this number to your doctor. They use it to link their certification to your claim in the SDI Online portal.
2. **Paper (Slow)**: If using mail, you must mail the Form DE 2501 Part B to your doctor to complete and mail in.

::callout{type="warning" title="Deadline for Certification"}
Both you and your doctor must submit your respective parts within **49 days** of your disability beginning.

## Supporting Documentation

These items help EDD verify your wages and pilot pay structure:

### Wage Documentation
- Your last 4 pay stubs (to prove CA SDI was withheld)
- Your most recent W-2

### Pilot Pay Explanation Cover Letter
Because airline pilot pay (trips, per diem, offsets) is unusual, we recommend submitting a cover letter explaining your pay structure. 

**What to include:**
- Semi-monthly pay frequency
- Explanation of Trip Pay vs. Per Diem
- Clarification that Sick Pay may be listed as "Regular Pay"
- Note that light duty is not available for pilots

::callout{type="tip" title="Use the Template"}
Go to the **[Templates](/templates)** page to download a pre-written cover letter for FedEx pilots.

## Who Can Certify Your Disability?

EDD accepts certifications from the following licensed practitioners:
- Medical Doctors (MD)
- Doctors of Osteopathy (DO)
- Nurse Practitioners (NP)
- Physician Assistants (PA)
- Chiropractors (for musculoskeletal only)
- Psychologists (for mental health)
- Dentists (for dental)
- Optometrists (for eye conditions)
- Podiatrists (for foot)
- Nurse Midwives (for pregnancy)

::callout{type="info" title="OAK Domicile Pilots"}
Many OAK domicile pilots use specialists in the Bay Area. Ensure your specialist is familiar with SDI Online, as it significantly speeds up processing.

### Work History Clarification

If your last months show mixed regular/sick pay:

```
WORK HISTORY CLARIFICATION

Month       | Status          | Type of Pay
------------|-----------------|------------------
January     | Working         | Flight Pay
February    | Working         | Flight Pay
March       | Partial Sick    | Mixed
April       | Full Sick Leave | Sick Pay Only
May         | Disabled        | No Pay
```

## Documentation for In-Person Filing

If filing in person, bring:

**Required:**

- [ ] Photo ID (driver's license or state ID)
- [ ] Social Security number (memorized is fine)
- [ ] Doctor's information (printed)

**Helpful:**

- [ ] Last 3 pay stubs
- [ ] Most recent W-2
- [ ] Written explanation of pilot pay
- [ ] Calculator results showing your expected benefit
- [ ] List of dates (last worked, disability start, etc.)

## What NOT to Include

Don't submit unless specifically requested:

- ❌ Entire medical history
- ❌ Every pay stub ever
- ❌ Irrelevant personal documents
- ❌ Duplicates of documents

More documents ≠ faster processing. Include what's needed and relevant.

## Keeping Copies

**Always Keep Copies Of:**

- Every document you submit
- Every form you complete
- All correspondence from EDD
- Your confirmation number and dates

**Organize By:**

- Date submitted
- Type of document
- Whether it was for EDD or Hartford

## If EDD Requests Additional Documents

When EDD requests more documentation:

1. **Read the request carefully** - What specifically do they want?
2. **Respond promptly** - Delays extend your processing time
3. **Send exactly what's requested** - Don't overwhelm with extras
4. **Keep copies** - Of everything you send
5. **Note the date** - When you responded

::callout{type="warning" title="EDD May Re-Request"}
EDD sometimes requests documents you've already sent. When responding, note "Previously submitted on [date]" and send again anyway.
