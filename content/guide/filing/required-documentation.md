# Required Documentation

A complete, accurate claim with proper documentation processes faster. Here's everything you need.

## Core Required Documents

### 1. Medical Certification

The most important document is your doctor's certification of your disability.

**Must Include:**
- Diagnosis or nature of disability
- Date disability began
- Expected duration
- Your ability (or inability) to work
- Doctor's signature and date
- Doctor's medical license number

::callout{type="warning" title="Doctor License Verification"}
EDD verifies every doctor's license with the Medical Board of California. This takes 7-10 business days. Ensure your doctor's license is current and information is accurate.
::

**How Doctor Certifies:**
- Online through EDD system (fastest)
- Paper form DE 2501 physician section
- Separate letter on office letterhead (sometimes acceptable)

### 2. Identification

**Primary ID:**
- California driver's license, OR
- California state ID, OR
- Other valid government-issued ID

**Social Security:**
- Full 9-digit Social Security Number
- Not the card itself, just the number

### 3. Employment Information

**From Your Records:**
- Employee ID number
- Employer name and address (as on pay stub)
- Last day worked date
- Job title: "Airline Pilot"

## Supporting Documents

These aren't always required but can help your claim:

### Wage Documentation

**If EDD Doesn't Have Accurate Wage Records:**
- Last 3-4 pay stubs
- W-2 forms from past 2 years
- Letter from employer verifying wages

::callout{type="tip" title="Pilot Pay Explanation"}
Consider including a brief explanation of pilot pay structure. EDD representatives may not understand flight pay, per diem, etc.
::

### Medical Records

**If Claim Is Complex:**
- Hospital discharge summaries
- Specialist reports
- Test results
- Surgery notes

Only provide medical records if specifically requested or if they help clarify your situation.

## Pilot-Specific Documentation

### Pay Structure Explanation

Consider including a one-page explanation:

```
AIRLINE PILOT PAY STRUCTURE - FOR EDD REFERENCE

I am an airline pilot. My pay differs from traditional employees:

1. FLIGHT PAY: Primary compensation, paid per flight hour
   - Hours vary month to month based on schedule
   - Not a fixed hourly wage

2. PER DIEM: Meal/expense allowance while traveling
   - Paid for duty periods away from base
   - Calculated based on hours away from base

3. FULL DISABILITY: As a pilot, I cannot perform
   modified or light duty. Any restriction that
   prevents me from flying makes me fully disabled
   for my occupation.

4. PAY PERIODS: FedEx pays semi-monthly (twice/month)

If you have questions about my pay records,
please contact me at [phone number].
```

### Work History Clarification

If your last months show mixed regular/sick pay:

```
WORK HISTORY CLARIFICATION

Month       | Status          | Type of Pay
------------|-----------------|------------------
January     | Working         | Flight Pay
February    | Working         | Flight Pay  
March       | Partial Sick    | Mixed
April       | Full Sick Leave | Sick Pay Only
May         | Disabled        | No Pay
```

## Documentation for In-Person Filing

If filing in person, bring:

**Required:**
- [ ] Photo ID (driver's license or state ID)
- [ ] Social Security number (memorized is fine)
- [ ] Doctor's information (printed)

**Helpful:**
- [ ] Last 3 pay stubs
- [ ] Most recent W-2
- [ ] Written explanation of pilot pay
- [ ] Calculator results showing your expected benefit
- [ ] List of dates (last worked, disability start, etc.)

## What NOT to Include

Don't submit unless specifically requested:

- ❌ Entire medical history
- ❌ Every pay stub ever
- ❌ Irrelevant personal documents
- ❌ Duplicates of documents

More documents ≠ faster processing. Include what's needed and relevant.

## Keeping Copies

**Always Keep Copies Of:**
- Every document you submit
- Every form you complete
- All correspondence from EDD
- Your confirmation number and dates

**Organize By:**
- Date submitted
- Type of document
- Whether it was for EDD or Hartford

## If EDD Requests Additional Documents

When EDD requests more documentation:

1. **Read the request carefully** - What specifically do they want?
2. **Respond promptly** - Delays extend your processing time
3. **Send exactly what's requested** - Don't overwhelm with extras
4. **Keep copies** - Of everything you send
5. **Note the date** - When you responded

::callout{type="warning" title="EDD May Re-Request"}
EDD sometimes requests documents you've already sent. When responding, note "Previously submitted on [date]" and send again anyway.
