# Filing Methods: Online vs. Mail vs. In-Person

You have three options for filing your CA SDI claim. Each has advantages and disadvantages.

## Quick Comparison

| Method        | Speed   | Convenience | Requirements               | Best For                   |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Online**    | Fastest | High        | **CA Driver's License/ID** | Most CA residents          |
| **Mail**      | Slowest | Medium      | None                       | **Out-of-state residents** |
| **In-Person** | Medium  | Low         | None                       | Complex situations         |

## Online Filing

### Pros

- ✅ Fastest processing and confirmation.
- ✅ Available 24/7.
- ✅ Easier to track status.

### Cons

- ❌ **Requires a California Driver's License or ID card** for registration.
- ❌ Out-of-state residents without a CA ID cannot file their initial claim online.
- ❌ Technical issues or "waiting rooms" are common on the EDD portal.

### How to File Online

1. Go to [edd.ca.gov](https://edd.ca.gov).
2. Create a **myEDD** account (requires ID.me verification).
3. Log in and select **SDI Online**.
4. Register for SDI Online (requires **CA DL/ID** or **EDDCAN**).
5. Complete the claim form and submit.

::callout{type="warning" title="Out-of-State Restriction"}
If you live out-of-state and do not have a California ID, you must file by mail for your first claim. You will receive an EDD Customer Account Number (EDDCAN) in the mail, which you can use for future online access.

## Mail Filing

### Pros

- ✅ No California ID requirement.
- ✅ Better for non-residents or those with complex employment history.
- ✅ Physical paper trail of what you submitted.

### Cons

- ❌ **Slowest method** (requires 2-3 extra weeks for mail and scanning).
- ❌ No immediate confirmation of receipt.
- ❌ High risk of delays if forms are filled out incorrectly or get lost in the mail.

### What You'll Need

- Social Security Number
- Driver's license or state ID number
- Last employer information
- Disability start date
- Doctor's information (name, phone, address, license number)
- Bank account for direct deposit (recommended)

## Mail Filing

### Pros

- ✅ Physical documentation
- ✅ Familiar process for some
- ✅ Can include extra documentation

### Cons

- ❌ Slowest method (add 1-2 weeks for mail time)
- ❌ No immediate confirmation
- ❌ Risk of mail delays or loss
- ❌ Harder to track status

### How to File by Mail

1. Obtain Form DE 2501 (available online or at EDD office)
2. Complete all sections carefully
3. Have your doctor complete the medical certification
4. Make copies of everything
5. Mail to the address on the form
6. Use certified mail with return receipt (recommended)

::callout{type="warning" title="Mail Delays"}
Mail filing typically adds 2+ weeks to your timeline. If you're close to the 49-day deadline, consider online or in-person instead.
::

### Mailing Address

The address is on the form, but typically:

```
State of California
Employment Development Department
P.O. Box 989
San Diego, CA 92112
```

Verify the current address on the form or EDD website.

## In-Person Filing

### Pros

- ✅ Immediate human assistance
- ✅ Can resolve complex questions on the spot
- ✅ Confirmation of receipt
- ✅ Can explain pilot pay structure directly

### Cons

- ❌ Very long wait times (4-6+ hours)
- ❌ Limited office hours
- ❌ Must travel to an office
- ❌ May still need follow-up

### How to File In-Person

1. Find your nearest EDD office (see [Contacts](/contacts))
2. Arrive EARLY (before doors open—see below)
3. Bring all required documents
4. Get a ticket/number when doors open
5. Wait to be called
6. Work with a representative to file

::callout{type="danger" title="Arrive Early!"}
EDD offices use a ticket system. If you arrive late, you may not get a ticket and will have to return another day. Arrive at least 30-60 minutes before the office opens.
::

### What to Bring In-Person

- [ ] Government-issued photo ID
- [ ] Social Security card (or number memorized)
- [ ] Last 3-4 pay stubs
- [ ] W-2 from most recent year
- [ ] Doctor's information (printed)
- [ ] Summary of your pay structure (helpful for explaining)
- [ ] Something to do while waiting (4-6 hours)

## Which Method Should You Choose?

### Choose Online If:

- You're comfortable with websites
- You have all information ready
- You want the fastest processing
- You can navigate the form questions

### Choose Mail If:

- You're not comfortable online
- You have plenty of time (nowhere near 49-day deadline)
- You want to include detailed explanatory documents

### Choose In-Person If:

- Your situation is complex
- You've been denied or had issues before
- You need to explain pilot pay structure
- You have time to spend at the office
- Online filing isn't working for you

## Hybrid Approach

Many pilots use a hybrid approach:

1. **Start online** to initiate the claim
2. **If issues arise**, go in-person to resolve
3. **Follow up by phone** for status updates

## After Filing

Regardless of method:

1. **Save confirmation:** Number, date, any documents received
2. **Follow up:** Check status online or by phone after 2 weeks
3. **Respond promptly:** To any requests for additional information
4. **Document everything:** Keep copies of all correspondence
