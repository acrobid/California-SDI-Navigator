# Step-by-Step Filing Guide

This guide walks you through the SDI claim filing process step by step.

## Before You Start

### Gather Required Information

Have these ready before starting:

**Personal Information:**

- Social Security Number (full 9 digits)
- Date of birth
- Driver's license or state ID number
- Current mailing address
- Phone number and email

**Employment Information:**

- FedEx's name and address
- Your employee ID
- Last day worked
- Usual occupation: "Airline Pilot"

**Medical Information:**

- Treating physician's name

- Doctor's medical license number (verify at mbc.ca.gov)
- Diagnosis (general description)
- Date disability began

**Financial Information:**

## Online Filing Steps

### Step 1: Access the EDD Website

1. Go to [edd.ca.gov](https://edd.ca.gov)
2. Click "Disability" in the main navigation
3. Select "File a Disability Insurance Claim"
4. Click "File a DI Claim Online"

### Step 2: Create or Log Into Account (myEDD)

EDD uses a central portal called **myEDD**.

1. **Register/Log In**: Click "Register" or "Log In" to access myEDD.
2. **Identity Verification (ID.me)**:
   - myEDD requires identity verification through **ID.me**.
   - You will need a government-issued photo ID (Driver's License, Passport, etc.).
   - This process can take 5-15 minutes but may be delayed if your ID documents don't match your account information Exactly.
3. **Connect to SDI Online**: Once your myEDD account is set up, select "SDI Online" to enter the disability claim portal.

::callout{type="warning" title="ID.me Warning"}
Do not wait until the day you are disabled to set up your account. We recommend setting up your myEDD account and completing ID.me verification while you are healthy.
::

### Step 3: Start New Claim

1. Select "File a New Disability Insurance Claim"
2. Confirm you meet eligibility requirements
3. **Medical Certification**: You will be asked how your physician will certify. Select "Online" if your doctor uses SDI Online (recommended).

### Step 4: Personal Information

Enter your personal details. Ensure these match your FedEx employment records and tax documents exactly.

- Social Security Number
- Date of birth
- Driver's license number
- Current mailing address (This is where your debit card will be sent)

### Step 5: Employment Information

**Last Employer Section:**

- Employer name: **Federal Express Corporation**
- Employer address: **3620 Hacks Cross Road, Building B 3rd Floor, Memphis, TN 38125**
- Supervisor/Verification: **Shelia Voye** (Pilot Administration Center Manager) or your base assistant
- Phone: **901-434-5000**
- Your occupation: **Airline Pilot**
- Last day worked: This is the **last day you physically flew or were on duty**.
- Reason for stopping work: Illness/Injury/Disability

::callout{type="info" title="Employer Contact Options"}
There is no single definitive contact for employer verification. The PAC (Pilot Administration Center) has access to the payroll data CA EDD requires. Shelia Voye is the PAC manager. Alternatively, some pilots use their base assistant's contact information—verify your base assistant can access payroll records before listing them. Note that PAC staff can be difficult to reach, and FedEx does not electronically submit information to CA EDD, which can delay benefit processing compared to employers who do.
::

::callout{type="tip" title="Date Ambiguity"}
If your last flight was August 28 and you didn't fly at all in September before becoming disabled on Oct 1, your "last day worked" remains August 28. However, your disability beginning date is the date the doctor certifies you were unable to work.
::

**Wage Information:**

- The system may pre-populate from state records
- Verify it looks reasonable
- Note any discrepancies

### Step 6: Disability Information

**Disability Start Date:**

- Enter the first day you were unable to work
- This is typically the day after your last worked day

**Type of Disability:**

- Select the category that best fits
- Provide brief description (e.g., "Surgery recovery" or "Medical condition")

**Are You in a Hospital?**

- Answer current status

### Step 7: Medical Provider Information

::callout{type="warning" title="Critical Section"}
Errors in doctor information cause significant delays. Verify everything is accurate, especially the license number.
::

**Doctor Information:**

- Full legal name of treating physician
- Medical license number (verify at mbc.ca.gov)
- Complete address
- Phone number
- Fax number (helpful for EDD to contact them)

**Treatment Information:**

- First date of treatment for this condition
- Last date of treatment (or ongoing)

### Step 8: Other Benefits

**Are you receiving or entitled to receive:**

- Workers' Compensation? (Usually No for illness)
- Other state disability? (No)
- Employer-paid sick leave? (May be Yes—answer honestly)

::callout{type="info" title="Sick Leave Question"}
If you're currently using sick leave, answer Yes. This doesn't disqualify you—EDD will coordinate benefits appropriately.
::

### Step 9: Payment Method

**Direct Deposit (Recommended):**

- Bank routing number (9 digits)
- Account number
- Account type (checking or savings)

**Debit Card:**

- EDD can issue a Bank of America debit card

### Step 10: Review and Submit

4. Submit the claim
5. **SAVE YOUR CONFIRMATION NUMBER**

## After Submitting

### Immediate Steps

3. **Note the date** you filed

### Within 24-48 Hours

1. You may receive email confirmation
2. Check your EDD account for claim status

### Doctor's Certification

Your doctor must complete their certification:

Ask your doctor:

- Can they complete online via EDD?
- Do they need a paper form?
- How long will it take them?

## Troubleshooting

### If the Website Has Errors

- Try a different browser
- Clear cache and cookies
- Try at a different time (early morning is usually better)

### If Doctor Information Is Wrong

Call EDD immediately to correct. Incorrect doctor information is a major cause of delays.
