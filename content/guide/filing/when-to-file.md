# When to File Your SDI Claim

Timing your SDI claim correctly is crucial. File too late and you lose benefits. File at the right time and you can minimize the impact of processing delays.

## The 49-Day Deadline

::callout{type="danger" title="Critical Deadline"}
You must file your SDI claim within **49 days** of becoming disabled. Missing this deadline can result in loss of benefits for the late period.
::

### What "Disabled" Means for Filing

Your disability date is generally:

- The first day you stopped working due to illness/injury
- The date your doctor says you became unable to work
- **Not** the date your sick bank runs out

### Counting the 49 Days

```
Day 0: Last day worked
Day 1: First day of disability (starts countdown)
...
Day 49: DEADLINE to file claim
```

::callout{type="warning" title="Don't Wait"}
The 49-day deadline is from disability START, not from when sick banks run out. Many pilots mistakenly wait to file until their sick banks are exhausted, risking missing the deadline.

## Optimal Filing Timing

### Best Practice: File Within the First Week

Why file immediately?

1. **Processing time:** EDD can take 2-6 weeks to process
2. **Buffer for issues:** Time to resolve any problems
3. **Deadline safety:** No risk of missing 49-day deadline
4. **Earlier payments:** Approval means payments start sooner

### Strategic Considerations

#### Base Period Optimization

If you're near a quarter boundary, check if waiting a few days changes your base period favorably:

| If You File In | Base Period       |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| March 31       | Oct '23 - Sep '24 |
| April 1        | Jan '24 - Dec '24 |

Calculate which gives you a higher "highest quarter" and file accordingly—but never miss the 49-day deadline to optimize base period.

#### Sick Bank Interaction

Filing SDI doesn't automatically conflict with sick bank pay:

- SDI has a 7-day waiting period (no pay for first week)
- After that, SDI pays for periods you're disabled and not receiving wages
- The interaction can be complex—file and let EDD determine

## What Date to Use

### The "Disability Begin Date"

On the SDI form, you'll need to specify when your disability began. For pilots:

**Use your last day worked** unless:

- Your doctor certifies an earlier date
- You were already unable to work before your last flight

::callout{type="info" title="Pilot-Specific Issue"}
Unlike traditional employees who might "try to work" while sick, pilots cannot fly with ANY restriction. Your last day worked is clearly the last day you were medically able to perform your duties.
::

### Common Date Confusion

| Situation                     | Use This Date                                       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Stopped flying due to illness | Last day you flew                                   |
| Scheduled surgery             | Day of surgery or first day unable to work          |
| Diagnosis preventing flight   | Date of diagnosis                                   |
| Gradual condition             | Date you stopped working (with doctor verification) |

## The 7-Day Waiting Period

SDI does not pay benefits for the first 7 days of your disability:

```
Days 1-7: Waiting period (no SDI payment)
Day 8+: SDI benefits begin (if approved)
```

This means:

- Your first payment covers from Day 8 onward
- The waiting period cannot be waived
- Sick bank typically covers this period

## Filing Checklist

Before filing, confirm you have:

- [ ] Your last day worked date
- [ ] Doctor's information (name, phone, address, license #)
- [ ] Your employment information
- [ ] Your contact information
- [ ] Understanding of your quarterly income
- [ ] SSN (you'll need the full number)

## What Happens After Filing

1. **Confirmation:** You receive confirmation number/document
2. **Processing:** EDD reviews your claim (14-21 days)
3. **Doctor Verification:** EDD verifies your doctor's license (7-10 days)
4. **Determination:** EDD approves or requests more information
5. **Payment:** If approved, first payment issues

Total typical timeline: 2-6 weeks if no complications

## Special Situations

### Elective Surgery

If you have a scheduled surgery:

- File on the day of surgery or first day you can't work
- Have your surgeon ready to provide certification
- Consider filing a day or two after to ensure paperwork is in order

### Intermittent Disability

Some conditions involve periods of disability followed by periods of work. This is complex for SDI—contact EDD directly for guidance.

### Pregnancy/Bonding

Pregnancy disability and bonding leave have specific programs (PDL and PFL). These are related but separate from standard SDI.
