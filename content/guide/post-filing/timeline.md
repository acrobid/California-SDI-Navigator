## Detailed Timeline Breakdown

### Phase 1: Filing & Certification (Days 1-14)

**What Happens:**
- You submit your part of the claim (DE 2501 Part A).
- Your physician submits the medical certification (Part B). **EDD cannot process your claim without Part B.**
- You receive a Claim Receipt Number.

**Action Required:**
- Provide your doctor with the Claim Receipt Number immediately.
- Verify through SDI Online that your doctor has submitted Part B.

### Phase 2: Review & Determination (Days 14-28)

**What Happens:**
- EDD verifies your base period wages.
- EDD reviews the medical certification for validity.
- You may receive a "Notice of Computation" (DE 429D) in the mail, which lists your reported wages and your potential weekly benefit amount. **This is not an approval letter.**

**Potential Issues:**
- EDD may flag your claim for identity verification (ID.me).
- EDD may request more information about your pilot pay structure.

### Phase 3: Payment (Days 28-35)

**What Happens:**
- If approved, your first payment is issued.
- **Waiting Period**: You are NOT paid for the first 7 days of your disability.
- **Retroactive Payment**: If your disability lasts more than 14 days, the 7-day waiting period is sometimes paid retroactively (depending on current policy).

**Payment Method:**
- Default: EDD Debit Card (Bank of America). This is mailed to you automatically.
- Optional: Direct Deposit. You must enroll for this in your SDI Online account.

## Long-Term Maintenance

### Every 2 Weeks: Continued Certification
You must certify every 14 days that you are still disabled and unable to work flight duty. This is done via SDI Online or by mail using Form DE 2500A.

### Every 1-3 Months: Physician Re-certification
Depending on the duration of your disability, EDD may require your doctor to provide an updated certification (Physician/Practitioner’s Supplementary Certificate - DE 2525XX).

Remember, your Hartford LTD benefits typically begin after 180 days. You must keep your SDI claim active and documented, as Hartford will require proof of your SDI status to calculate your LTD offset.

## If Things Take Longer

### Normal Delays

Some delays are expected:

- Quarter-end processing backlogs
- Holiday periods

### Signs of a Problem

Contact EDD if:

- No status change after 3 weeks
- You haven't received any correspondence
- Status shows "Incomplete" without explanation
- Your doctor hasn't been contacted

### Escalation Options

1. **Call EDD** - Start with the main line
2. **Visit in person** - For complex issues
3. **Contact your Assembly member** - For unresponsive EDD
4. **ALPA** - Union can sometimes assist

## Continuing Certification

For ongoing disabilities, you must continue to certify:

**Every Two Weeks:**

- Confirm you're still disabled
- Report any changes
- Complete online or by mail

::callout{type="danger" title="Don't Miss Certifications"}
Missing continuing certifications can stop your benefits even if you're approved.

**Solution:**
