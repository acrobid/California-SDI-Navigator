## Online Tracking

Check your claim status every 2-3 days during active processing. EDD sometimes updates status without sending notifications.

### What You'll See Online

**Claim Information:**
- Claim ID
- Disability begin date
- Current status
- Payment history

**Messages/Correspondence:**
- Any requests from EDD
- Determination letters
- Important notices

**Payment History:**
- Dates of payments
- Amounts paid
- Payment method used

## Status Codes Explained

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Claim received, under review |
| **Incomplete** | Missing information required from you |
| **Physician Certification Needed** | Doctor hasn't submitted Part B yet (CRITICAL) |
| **Medical Review** | EDD medical staff is reviewing your doctor's certification |
| **Additional Information Requested** | EDD needs more documentation (often pay-related) |
| **Approved - Payment Pending** | Approved, awaiting payment processing |
| **Paid** | Payment issued to your card or bank account |
| **Denied** | Claim denied (Review letter for appeal details) |
| **Suspended** | On hold for investigation or missing certification |

### Status That Need Immediate Attention

**Physician Certification Needed:**
If this stays for more than 48 hours after you filed Part A, your doctor likely hasn't submitted their part. Your claim is effectively frozen until this happens.

**Additional Information Requested:**
For pilots, this often means EDD found a discrepancy between your reported wages and FedEx's reported data (which may include sick bank usage listed as regular pay). Check your messages for a request to submit pay stubs or an explanation of pay.

**Suspended:**
This usually occurs if you missed a bi-weekly certification or if there's an identity verification issue. Call the EDD main line immediately if you see this.

## Phone Tracking

### When to Call
- Status hasn't updated in 14 days.
- You've already submitted requested info but status is still "Incomplete".
- You need to report a return to work date that differs from your initial claim.

### How to Call EDD
**Main SDI Line:** 1-800-480-3287
- **Best time to call:** 8:00 AM sharp, or mid-week.
- **Wait times:** Prepare for 45-90 minutes.
- **Language:** If you can't get through on the English line, sometimes the Spanish or Cantonese lines have shorter waits if you are bi-lingual.

### What to Ask the Representative
1. "Has my physician's Part B been successfully linked to my claim?"
2. "Are there any flags for identity verification (ID.me) on my account?"
3. "Are my highest quarterly wages appearing correctly in your system?"
4. "Is there any additional information needed regarding my FedEx pay structure?"
