# If Your SDI Claim Is Denied

A denial is frustrating but not the end. Many denials are overturned on appeal.

## Understanding Your Denial

### Denial Letter

You'll receive a denial letter explaining:

- The reason for denial
- Your appeal rights
- Deadline to appeal
- How to appeal

::callout{type="warning" title="Read Carefully"}
The denial reason determines your best appeal strategy. Read the entire letter carefully.

## Common Denial Situations

### "Not Disabled"

**What It Means:**
EDD doesn't believe you're unable to work.

**How to Appeal:**

1. Get detailed letter from doctor explaining:
   - Your diagnosis
   - Why you cannot work
   - Expected duration
   - Specific limitations

2. Explain pilot-specific issues:
   - No "light duty" for pilots
   - Any restriction grounds all flying
   - FAA medical requirements

**Include:**

- Detailed medical records
- Doctor's explicit statement
- FAA medical status if relevant

### "Insufficient Base Period Wages"

**What It Means:**
EDD doesn't see enough wages in your base period.

**How to Appeal:**

1. Verify which base period they used
2. Calculate if you should qualify
3. Provide wage documentation proving earnings

**Include:**

- Pay stubs for base period
- W-2 forms
- Calculation showing you qualify

### "Medical Certification Not Received"

**What It Means:**
EDD didn't receive or couldn't verify doctor's certification.

**How to Appeal:**

1. Contact your doctor immediately
2. Have them re-submit certification
3. Verify they're using correct license number
4. Ask doctor to call EDD directly if needed

**Include:**

- New, complete certification
- Doctor's written statement
- Proof of previous attempts if applicable

### "Filed After 49-Day Deadline"

**What It Means:**
EDD believes you filed too late.

**How to Appeal (if applicable):**

1. Prove you filed on time (if you did)
2. Show "good cause" for late filing if late

**Good Cause Examples:**
