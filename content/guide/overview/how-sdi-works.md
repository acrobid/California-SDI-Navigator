# How CA SDI Works

California State Disability Insurance (SDI) is a state-mandated program that provides partial wage replacement to eligible workers who are unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy.

## The Basics

### What Is SDI?

SDI is funded through mandatory payroll deductions from California workers. As a FedEx pilot based in California (OAK domicile), you are required by law to participate in this program.

**Key Points:**
- SDI provides approximately 60-70% of your wages (with caps)
- Benefits can last up to 52 weeks depending on your condition
- It covers non-work-related disabilities only (work injuries go through Workers' Comp)

### 2026 SDI Rates

| Item | 2026 Value |
|------|------------|
| SDI Tax Rate | 1.3% of ALL wages |
| Maximum Weekly Benefit | $1,681 |
| Maximum Duration | Up to 52 weeks |
| Tax Cap | **None** (uncapped since 2024) |

::callout{type="warning" title="Important Change in 2024"}
Prior to 2024, SDI taxes were capped at a maximum taxable wage. Starting January 1, 2024, **there is no cap**. You pay SDI tax on 100% of your California wages, no matter how much you earn.

### How Benefits Are Calculated

Your weekly benefit is calculated as:

```
Weekly Benefit = (Highest Quarter Wages in Base Period ÷ 13) × 70%
```

The "base period" is a 12-month period determined by when you file your claim:

| Claim Filed | Base Period |
|-------------|-------------|
| January - March | Oct (2 years prior) through Sep (1 year prior) |
| April - June | Jan through Dec (1 year prior) |
| July - September | Apr (1 year prior) through Mar (current year) |
| October - December | Jul (1 year prior) through Jun (current year) |

**Example:**
- Filing claim in February 2026
- Base period: October 2023 through September 2024
- Highest quarter: $95,000
- Weekly benefit: ($95,000 ÷ 13) × 0.70 = $5,115... capped at $1,681/week

### Who Qualifies?

To be eligible for CA SDI, you must:

1. Be unable to do your regular work for at least 8 consecutive days
2. Have lost wages due to your disability
3. Have earned at least $300 during your base period
4. Be under the care of a licensed physician
5. File a claim within 49 days of becoming disabled

::callout{type="tip" title="For Pilots"}
As an airline pilot, you cannot perform "modified duty." If you have ANY restriction that prevents you from flying, you are fully disabled for SDI purposes. There is no partial disability in our profession.

## The EDD Connection

### What is EDD?

The Employment Development Department (EDD) is the California state agency that administers the SDI program (among other programs like unemployment insurance).

### The Challenge for Pilots

The EDD system was designed for traditional employees with:
- Regular monthly paychecks
- Consistent work schedules
- Simple pay structures

Airline pilots have:
- Variable schedules month to month
- Complex pay (flight pay, per diem, premium pay, etc.)
- Sick pay that looks identical to regular pay on statements

This mismatch creates confusion and delays when processing pilot claims.

## How Long Does It Take?

Typical timeline for SDI claims:

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Initial processing | 14-21 days |
| Doctor license verification | 7-10 business days |
| Additional document requests | Variable |
| First payment | 2-6 weeks from filing (if no issues) |

::callout{type="warning" title="Delays Are Common"}
Many pilots experience significant delays due to EDD's difficulty understanding pilot pay structures. Plan accordingly and file as early as possible.
