# How CA SDI Works

California State Disability Insurance (SDI) is a state-mandated program that provides partial wage replacement to eligible workers who are unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy.

## The Basics

### What Is SDI?

SDI is funded through mandatory payroll deductions from California workers. As a FedEx pilot based in California (OAK domicile), you are required by law to participate in this program.

**Key Points:**

- SDI provides approximately 60-70% of your wages (with caps)
- Benefits can last up to 52 weeks depending on your condition
- It covers non-work-related disabilities only (work injuries go through Workers' Comp)

### 2026 SDI Rates

| Item                   | 2026 Value                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| SDI Tax Rate           | 1.3% of ALL wages              |
| Maximum Weekly Benefit | $1,681                         |
| Maximum Duration       | Up to 52 weeks                 |
| Tax Cap                | **None** (uncapped since 2024) |

::callout{type="warning" title="Important Change in 2024"}
Prior to 2024, SDI taxes were capped at a maximum taxable wage. Starting January 1, 2024, **there is no cap**. You pay SDI tax on 100% of your California wages, no matter how much you earn.

### How Benefits Are Calculated

Your weekly benefit is calculated as:

```
Weekly Benefit = (Highest Quarter Wages in Base Period ÷ 13) × 70%
```

The "base period" is a 12-month period determined by when you file your claim:

| Claim Filed        | Base Period                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| January - March    | Oct (2 years prior) through Sep (1 year prior) |
| April - June       | Jan through Dec (1 year prior)                 |
| July - September   | Apr (1 year prior) through Mar (current year)  |
| October - December | Jul (1 year prior) through Jun (current year)  |

**Example:**

- Filing claim in February 2026
- Base period: October 2023 through September 2024
- Highest quarter: $95,000
- Weekly benefit: ($95,000 ÷ 13) × 0.70 = $5,115... capped at $1,681/week

### Who Qualifies?

To be eligible for CA SDI, you must:

1. **Employment Status**: Be employed or actively looking for work at the time your disability began.
2. **Medical Certification**: Be unable to do your regular or customary work for at least 8 consecutive days.
3. **Earnings**: Have earned at least $300 during your base period (from which SDI deductions were withheld).
4. **Under Care**: Be under the care and treatment of a licensed physician/practitioner during the first 8 days of disability.
5. **Filing Deadline**: File your claim within **49 days** of the date your disability began.

::callout{type="tip" title="For Pilots"}
As an airline pilot, you cannot perform "modified duty." If you have ANY restriction that prevents you from flying, you are fully disabled for SDI purposes. There is no partial disability in our profession.

## The EDD Connection

### What is EDD?

The Employment Development Department (EDD) is the California state agency that administers the SDI program (among other programs like unemployment insurance).

### The Challenge for Pilots

The EDD system was designed for traditional employees with:

- Regular monthly paychecks
- Consistent work schedules
- Simple pay structures

Airline pilots have:

- Variable schedules month to month
- Complex pay (flight pay, per diem, premium pay, etc.)
- Sick pay that looks identical to regular pay on statements

This mismatch creates confusion and delays when processing pilot claims.

## How Long Does It Take?

Typical timeline for SDI claims:

Day 0: Last day worked / Disability begins
Days 1-7: File claim (ideally within first week)
Days 1-14: Physician certifies claim (critical step)
Days 14-21: EDD reviews claim, may request additional info
Days 21-28: Eligibility determination
~Day 28+: First payment issued (if approved)
Every 2 weeks: Continued claim certification required

### Eligibility Base Period Definition

The base period is a specific 12-month period that determines both eligibility and benefit amount. EDD looks at wages reported during those quarters.

| Claim Filed        | Base Period Used                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| January - March    | October through September (15-18 months prior)    |
| April - June       | January through December (previous calendar year) |
| July - September   | April through March (4-15 months prior)           |
| October - December | July through June (4-15 months prior)             |

**Example for a pilot filing in January 2026:**

- Base period = October 1, 2024 - September 30, 2025
- EDD calculates benefit based on the highest-earning quarter in this window.
  | Doctor license verification | 7-10 business days |
  | Additional document requests | Variable |
  | First payment | 2-6 weeks from filing (if no issues) |

::callout{type="warning" title="Delays Are Common"}
Many pilots experience significant delays due to EDD's difficulty understanding pilot pay structures. Plan accordingly and file as early as possible.
