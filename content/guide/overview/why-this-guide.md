# Why This Guide Exists

Every pilot who has navigated the CA SDI process has had to figure it out largely from scratch. This guide exists to change that.

## The Problem

### Information Asymmetry

When you become disabled as a California-based FedEx pilot, you encounter:

- **No official documentation** specifically for pilot claims
- **EDD systems** designed for typical W-2 employees, not pilots
- **Pay structures** that don't translate well to EDD's understanding
- **Two bureaucracies** (EDD and Hartford) that don't coordinate
- **Time pressure** when you're already dealing with health issues

### Repeated Effort

Each pilot who goes through this process:

- Spends dozens of hours researching and making calls
- Makes mistakes that cause delays
- Discovers tips and tricks that would have saved time
- Eventually figures it out—then keeps the knowledge to themselves

When that pilot recovers and moves on, the institutional knowledge is lost. The next pilot starts from scratch.

### Financial Consequences

Mistakes in this process can cost you:

- **Thousands of dollars** in delayed or reduced benefits
- **Missed deadlines** that forfeit appeal rights
- **Bureaucratic delays** that extend financial hardship
- **Unnecessary stress** during an already difficult time

## The Solution

### Collective Knowledge

This guide consolidates the experience of pilots who have successfully navigated the process:

- Step-by-step procedures that actually work
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Time-saving tips from real experience
- Templates for common communications
- Tools to calculate benefits and track progress

### Living Document

This resource is designed to be:

- **Updated** when laws and rates change
- **Improved** based on pilot feedback
- **Expanded** as new situations are documented
- **Maintained** by the pilot community

## Who Is This For?

### Active Claimants

If you're currently disabled or about to become disabled, this guide provides:

- Immediate, actionable guidance
- Checklists to track your progress
- Calculators to understand your benefits
- Templates to communicate effectively

### Preparing Pilots

If you have a surgery scheduled or anticipate a disability:

- Preparation steps you can take now
- Documents to gather before you need them
- Understanding of the process before stress hits
- Optimal timing for filing claims

### Healthy Pilots

Even if you're perfectly healthy now:

- Understand what you're paying for (SDI taxes)
- Know what to expect if you ever need it
- Save documents proactively
- Help colleagues who are going through it

## What This Guide Doesn't Do

To be clear about the limits:

::callout{type="warning" title="Important Limitations"}

- **Not legal advice:** Consult an attorney for legal questions
- **Not medical advice:** Follow your doctor's guidance
- **Not union representation:** Contact ALPA for official union matters
- **Not guaranteed:** Every situation is different

## The Community Aspect

This guide exists because pilots helped pilots. The information here comes from:

- Pilots who documented their own experiences
- Subject matter experts who contributed knowledge
- Colleagues who reviewed and improved content
- Everyone who shared tips and warnings

If you successfully navigate this process, consider contributing your own insights to help the next pilot.
