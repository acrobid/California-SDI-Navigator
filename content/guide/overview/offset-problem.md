# The Offset Problem

This is the core issue that this guide exists to help you navigate. Understanding the offset problem is essential for any California-based FedEx pilot who may need disability benefits.

## What Is the Offset Problem?

When you become disabled and transition to Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefits, The Hartford reduces your LTD payment by the amount they expect you to receive from California State Disability Insurance (SDI).

**The problem:** This reduction happens **regardless of whether you've actually received your SDI payment.**

::callout{type="danger" title="The Real-World Impact"}
You may be receiving LTD payments that are reduced by $5,000-7,000+ per month for SDI you haven't actually received yet. This can continue for weeks or months while EDD processes your claim.
::

## How It Works

### The Theory

In theory, the offset is supposed to work like this:

1. You become disabled and file for both SDI and LTD
2. You receive SDI weekly payments (~$1,681/week max)
3. Hartford calculates your LTD and reduces it by the SDI amount
4. **Net result:** You receive roughly the same total income, just from two sources

### The Reality

In reality, here's what often happens:

1. You become disabled and file for SDI and LTD
2. EDD takes weeks or months to process your SDI claim
3. Hartford starts paying LTD **already reduced** by expected SDI
4. You receive no SDI but your LTD is already reduced
5. **Net result:** You receive significantly less income during the delay

### Example Scenario

| Without Delay       | With 2-Month EDD Delay |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| LTD: $17,000/mo     | LTD: $17,000/mo        |
| Offset: -$7,000     | Offset: -$7,000        |
| SDI: +$7,000        | SDI: $0 (delayed)      |
| **Net: $17,000/mo** | **Net: $10,000/mo**    |

In this example, you're effectively losing $7,000/month during the EDD processing delay—potentially $14,000-21,000 or more over a typical 2-3 month delay.

## Why Does Hartford Do This?

### Legal Basis

Hartford's plan documents likely specify that benefits are offset by amounts the claimant is "entitled to receive" or "expected to receive," not just amounts actually received.

### Their Perspective

From Hartford's perspective:

- California requires SDI coverage, so you should be filing for it
- The SDI amount is calculable based on your wages
- They want to avoid paying twice for the same disability period

### The Unfairness

From your perspective:

- You're paying SDI taxes (1.3% of ALL income, uncapped since 2024)
- You're doing the bureaucratic work of filing a claim
- But if there are delays, YOU bear the financial burden, not Hartford

## Comparison: California vs. Other Bases

| Situation           | CA-Based Pilot               | Memphis-Based Pilot |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| SDI Taxes Paid      | ~$5,000-8,000/year           | $0                  |
| LTD Offset          | Yes (for SDI)                | No SDI offset       |
| Bureaucratic Burden | High                         | Low                 |
| Net Benefit         | Same (if no delays)          | Same                |
| Risk if Delays      | Significant income reduction | No SDI-related risk |

::callout{type="info" title="The Inequity"}
California-based pilots pay thousands in additional taxes for a benefit that, when functioning properly, provides zero additional net income. And when there are delays, CA pilots suffer reduced income that pilots at other bases never experience.

## Historical Context

### Before 2024

- SDI taxes were capped at a maximum wage base (~$165,000 in 2023)
- Maximum SDI tax was around $1,500/year
- The offset problem existed but had limited financial impact

### After 2024 (SB951)

- SDI taxes now apply to ALL income with no cap
- High-earning pilots can pay $5,000-8,000+ per year in SDI taxes
- The financial stakes of the offset problem have dramatically increased
- Processing delays have become much more consequential

## What Can You Do?

### Minimize Delays

The best strategy is to minimize EDD processing delays:

1. **File early:** Don't wait until your sick bank is exhausted
2. **File correctly:** Avoid errors that cause rejections
3. **Be proactive:** Follow up regularly on your claim
4. **Document everything:** Keep records of all communications

### Track Deadlines

- **49-day filing deadline:** Don't miss this or you may lose benefits
- **6-month Hartford appeal deadline:** Critical if you disagree with offset calculation
- **Document all dates:** Create a timeline of your claim

### Use This Guide

Follow the guidance in this resource:

- [Preparation](/guide/preparation/understanding-pay) - Get ready before you need to file
- [Filing](/guide/filing/when-to-file) - Submit your claim correctly
- [Checklist](/checklist) - Track your progress
- [Timeline](/timeline) - Monitor your deadlines

### Consider Appealing

If Hartford's offset seems incorrect or excessive:

- Review their calculation methodology
- Check if they're offsetting correctly
- Consider appealing through ALPA's PBRB process

## The Bigger Picture

Some pilots have successfully argued for changes to how offsets are applied or for reimbursement when SDI payments were delayed. This often requires:

- Thorough documentation
- Understanding of plan language
- Sometimes legal assistance
- Persistence

::callout{type="tip" title="Document Now"}
Even if you're not currently disabled, start documenting now:

- Save pay stubs
- Understand your sick bank
- Know your contacts
- Review this guide

Being prepared can save you thousands of dollars and countless hours of stress.
