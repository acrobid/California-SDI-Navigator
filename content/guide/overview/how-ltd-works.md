# How FedEx LTD Works

FedEx provides Long-Term Disability (LTD) insurance to pilots through The Hartford. This benefit is designed to replace a portion of your income if you become unable to work for an extended period.

## The Basics

### What is LTD?

LTD insurance provides monthly income if you become disabled and cannot perform your job duties as a pilot. Unlike short-term solutions like sick banks, LTD is designed for extended disabilities.

### Coverage Levels

| Duration | Benefit Level |
|----------|---------------|
| First 2 years | 60% of pre-disability earnings |
| After 2 years | 50% of pre-disability earnings |

::callout{type="info" title="Important Limits"}
LTD benefits are calculated on compensation up to the IRS 401(a)(17) limit, which is **$350,000 for 2026**. Earnings above this cap are not included in benefit calculations.
::

### How Benefits Are Calculated

Your LTD benefit is based on:

1. Your highest 12 consecutive months of earnings in the 36 months before disability
2. Divided by 12 to get a monthly average
3. Multiplied by 60% (years 1-2) or 50% (year 3+)

**Example:**
- Highest 12-month earnings: $380,000
- Capped at 401(a)(17) limit: $350,000
- Monthly average: $350,000 ÷ 12 = $29,167
- Year 1-2 benefit: $29,167 × 60% = $17,500/month
- Year 3+ benefit: $29,167 × 50% = $14,583/month

## Definition of Disability

### Own Occupation (First 24 Months)

For the first 24 months, you're considered disabled if you cannot perform the material duties of **your own occupation** as a pilot.

### Any Occupation (After 24 Months)

After 24 months, the definition changes. You're considered disabled only if you cannot perform **any occupation** for which you're reasonably qualified by education, training, or experience.

::callout{type="warning" title="The 24-Month Transition"}
Many disabilities that qualify under "own occupation" may not qualify under "any occupation." This is when many claims are terminated. Be aware of this transition and prepare accordingly.
::

## When Does LTD Begin?

LTD benefits typically begin after a waiting period:

1. **Elimination Period:** Usually 180 days from your last day worked
2. This period is often covered by:
   - Sick bank
   - Disability Sick Absence (DSA) bank
   - Short-term disability (if applicable)
   - CA SDI

The timeline typically looks like:

```
Day 0:        Last day worked
Days 1-180:   Sick bank, DSA, SDI covering lost income
Day 181+:     LTD begins (if still disabled)
```

## Offsets

::callout{type="danger" title="Critical Concept"}
The Hartford reduces your LTD benefit by amounts you receive (or are **expected** to receive) from other sources. This is called an "offset."
::

### Common Offsets Include:

| Source | Offset? |
|--------|---------|
| California SDI | **Yes** |
| Social Security Disability | Yes |
| Workers' Compensation | Yes |
| VA Disability | Usually No |
| Retirement income | Depends |

### The California Problem

For California-based pilots, The Hartford will offset your LTD by the CA SDI amount you're **expected** to receive—even if:

- You haven't filed for SDI yet
- You've filed but are waiting for approval
- You've been approved but haven't received payment

This creates the core problem this guide addresses: you may receive reduced LTD payments before you've actually received SDI.

## The Hartford Claims Process

### Filing a Claim

1. Report your disability to The Hartford (usually through FedEx benefits)
2. Complete required claim forms
3. Provide medical documentation
4. Hartford reviews and makes a determination

### What Hartford Needs

- Medical records supporting disability
- Proof of earnings (usually from FedEx payroll)
- Information about other benefits you may receive
- Ongoing medical updates

### Communication

- Hartford will assign a claims examiner
- Keep records of all communications
- Respond promptly to requests for information
- Document everything in writing when possible

## Appeal Rights

If Hartford denies your claim or you disagree with their offset calculation:

1. **Internal Appeal:** File within the timeframe specified in your denial letter
2. **PBRB Review:** Request review through ALPA's Pilot Benefit Review Board
3. **Legal Action:** ERISA provides rights to sue in federal court

::callout{type="danger" title="6-Month Deadline"}
You typically have **6 months** from a Hartford decision to file an appeal. Missing this deadline can forfeit your rights. Track this date carefully!
::
