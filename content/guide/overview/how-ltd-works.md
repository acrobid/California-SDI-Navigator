# How FedEx LTD Works

FedEx provides Long-Term Disability (LTD) insurance to pilots as specified in the CBA. This benefit is designed to replace a portion of your income if you become unable to work for an extended period.

::callout{type="warning" title="Claims Administrator"}
The CBA Section 27.J references **Aetna Life Insurance Company** as the claims administrator. However, some documentation references The Hartford. Verify the current administrator with FedEx Benefits Service Center (1-855-545-4748) before filing. See [Contacts](/contacts) for more information.
::

## The Basics

### What is LTD?

LTD insurance provides monthly income if you become disabled and cannot perform your job duties as a pilot. Unlike short-term solutions like sick banks, LTD is designed for extended disabilities.

### Coverage Levels (CBA Section 27.J.2)

| Duration | Benefit Level |
|----------|---------------|
| Months 1-24 | **60%** of monthly earnings |
| Months 25+ | **50%** of monthly earnings |

::callout{type="info" title="Important Limits"}
LTD benefits are calculated on compensation up to the IRS 401(a)(17) limit, which is **$350,000 for 2026**. Earnings above this cap are not included in benefit calculations.
::

### How Benefits Are Calculated (CBA Section 27.J.6)

Your LTD benefit is based on:

> "The 12 highest consecutive months out of the 36 consecutive months preceding the disability period"

**Calculation steps:**
1. Identify your highest 12 consecutive months of earnings in the 36 months before disability
2. Divide by 12 to get monthly earnings
3. Multiply by 60% (months 1-24) or 50% (months 25+)
4. Cap at IRS 401(a)(17) limit

**Example:**
- Highest 12-month period: $380,000
- Capped at 401(a)(17) limit: $350,000
- Monthly earnings: $350,000 ÷ 12 = $29,167
- Months 1-24 benefit: $29,167 × 60% = $17,500/month (capped at $17,500)
- Months 25+ benefit: $29,167 × 50% = $14,583/month

**See [Benefit Calculation Guide](/guide/hartford/calculation) for complete details.**

## Definition of Disability

### Own Occupation (First 24 Months)

For the first 24 months, you're considered disabled if you cannot perform the material duties of **your own occupation** as a pilot.

### Any Occupation (After 24 Months)

After 24 months, the definition changes. You're considered disabled only if you cannot perform **any occupation** for which you're reasonably qualified by education, training, or experience.

::callout{type="warning" title="The 24-Month Transition"}
Many disabilities that qualify under "own occupation" may not qualify under "any occupation." This is when many claims are terminated. Be aware of this transition and prepare accordingly.
::

## When Does LTD Begin? (CBA Section 27.J.1)

**Important:** LTD eligibility is triggered by specific events, not just a time period:

**LTD begins when ONE of these occurs:**
1. **Exhaustion of sick banks** - Both regular sick AND DSA depleted
2. **Disability-related seat change** - Bidding down due to medical restrictions
3. **Move to non-pilot position** - Transitioning to ground position due to disability

::callout{type="info" title="Not Just Time-Based"}
Unlike many LTD plans, the FedEx plan does NOT begin simply after 180 days. You must meet one of the eligibility triggers. See [LTD Eligibility](/guide/hartford/eligibility) for complete details.
::

## Offsets (CBA Sections 27.J.13, 27.J.15)

::callout{type="danger" title="Critical Concept"}
The LTD administrator reduces your LTD benefit by amounts you receive (or are **expected** to receive) from other sources. This is called an "offset."
::

### Offset Rules by Type:

| Source | Offset Amount | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| California SDI | **100%** | Full amount offset |
| Social Security Disability (SSDI) | **70%** only | Only 70% of pilot's SSDI (family benefits NOT offset) |
| Outside income | **50% of excess** | Only if total exceeds pre-disability income |
| Workers' Compensation | Varies | Check plan documents |
| VA Disability | Usually No | Separate offset rules may apply |

**Key CBA provisions:**

- **SSDI:** Only 70% of your personal SSDI is offset (disabilities after Oct 30, 2006). Family benefits are NOT offset.
- **Outside income:** Only offset if your total income (LTD + outside) exceeds your pre-disability total income (FedEx + outside). Then only 50% of the excess is offset.

**See [Comprehensive Offset Guide](/guide/hartford/offsets) for details and examples.**

### The California Problem

For California-based pilots, the administrator will offset your LTD by the CA SDI amount you're **expected** to receive—even if:

- You haven't filed for SDI yet
- You've filed but are waiting for approval
- You've been approved but haven't received payment

This creates the core problem this guide addresses: you may receive reduced LTD payments before you've actually received SDI.

## Cooperation Requirements (CBA Section 27.J.4)

To maintain LTD benefits, you must:

- Fully cooperate with the claims administrator
- Coordinate with the Aeromedical Advisor
- Diligently seek restoration of your FAA medical certificate
- Respond promptly to information requests
- Attend required medical examinations

**See [Cooperation Requirements](/guide/hartford/cooperation) for complete details.**

## Duration Limits (CBA Sections 27.J.10, 27.J.11)

| Condition Type | Maximum Duration |
|----------------|------------------|
| General physical disabilities | Until recovery or age 65 |
| Mental health conditions | **60 months** (5 years) |
| Substance abuse | **18 months** (12 + 6 for recertification) |

**See [Duration Limits](/guide/hartford/duration) for complete details.**

## The Claims Process

### Filing a Claim

1. Determine which administrator handles claims (Aetna or Hartford)
2. Contact the administrator (see [Contacts](/contacts))
3. Complete required claim forms
4. Provide medical documentation
5. Administrator reviews and makes a determination

### What the Administrator Needs

- Medical records supporting disability
- Proof of earnings (usually from FedEx payroll)
- Information about other benefits you may receive
- Ongoing medical updates

### Communication

- Administrator will assign a claims examiner
- Keep records of all communications
- Respond promptly to requests for information
- Document everything in writing when possible

## Appeal Rights

If the administrator denies your claim or you disagree with their calculation:

1. **Internal Appeal:** File within the timeframe specified in your denial letter
2. **PBRB Review:** Request review through ALPA's Pilot Benefit Review Board
3. **Legal Action:** ERISA provides rights to sue in federal court

::callout{type="danger" title="6-Month Deadline"}
You typically have **180 days (6 months)** from a decision to file an appeal. Missing this deadline can forfeit your rights. Track this date carefully!
::

## Company System Access (CBA Section 27.J.19)

While on disability, you retain access to:
- pilot.fedex.com
- PRISM
- Company email (@fedex.com)

This is a contractual right. If access is lost, contact IT and reference CBA Section 27.J.19.

**See [Company System Access](/guide/hartford/company-access) for details.**

## Working with the Administrator

### Tips for Success

- **Document everything:** Keep copies of all submissions and correspondence
- **Be proactive:** Don't wait for administrator to contact you
- **Respond promptly:** Delays in responding can delay your benefits
- **Keep good records:** Medical records, pay stubs, communications
- **Understand your plan:** Request and read your actual plan documents
- **Know the CBA:** Reference specific CBA sections when needed
