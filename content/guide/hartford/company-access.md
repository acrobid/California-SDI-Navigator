# Company System Access While Disabled

According to the Collective Bargaining Agreement:

> "During the period that a pilot is on disability, the pilot shall have access to Company communications systems including pilot.fedex.com, PRISM and Company email."

This guarantees your continued access to:

1. **pilot.fedex.com** - Company pilot portal
2. **PRISM** - Scheduling and bid system
3. **Company email** - Your @fedex.com email address
