# When LTD Benefits Begin

Understanding when you become eligible for Long-Term Disability (LTD) benefits is critical for financial planning. Unlike many LTD plans that simply use a time-based elimination period, the FedEx LTD Plan has specific triggering events.

## LTD Eligibility Triggers (CBA Section 27.J.1)

According to the Collective Bargaining Agreement, LTD eligibility is triggered by **ONE** of these events:

### 1. Exhaustion of Sick Banks

**Most common trigger:** You become eligible when you exhaust **both**:

- Regular sick account
- Disability sick account (DSA)

::callout{type="info" title="Both Banks Must Be Depleted"}
LTD does NOT begin when just one bank is exhausted. Both your regular sick and DSA accounts must be fully depleted.
::

**How to check:**

- Log into Workday
- View your sick bank balances
- Calculate your burn rate based on current disability

**Example:**

```
Regular sick: 120 hours (15 days)
DSA balance:  480 hours (60 days)
Total:        600 hours (75 days)

If using 8 hours per day → LTD eligible after 75 days
```

### 2. Disability-Related Seat Change

You become eligible if you bid down to a lower seat **because of disability**:

**Examples:**

- Captain → First Officer due to medical restrictions
- Wide-body → Narrow-body due to inability to handle longer flights
- International → Domestic due to medical limitations

::callout{type="warning" title="Must Be Disability-Related"}
The seat change must be **caused by your disability**, not by personal preference or seniority.
::

**Documentation needed:**

- Medical documentation showing restrictions
- Proof that restrictions prevent you from holding current seat
- Bid award showing the seat change

### 3. Move to Non-Pilot Position

You become eligible if you move to a ground position **because of disability**:

**Examples:**

- Pilot → Flight operations coordinator
- Pilot → Training department
- Pilot → Safety department

::callout{type="info" title="Maintaining Company Employment"}
This allows pilots who can no longer fly but can work in other capacities to receive LTD benefits while transitioning.
::

## Important Distinctions

### NOT a Simple Time-Based Trigger

**Common misconception:** "LTD begins after 180 days"

**Reality:** The 180-day elimination period is NOT the sole trigger. You must meet one of the three eligibility criteria above.

### Timing Can Vary Widely

| Scenario              | Time to LTD Eligibility |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Large sick banks      | 6+ months               |
| Smaller sick banks    | 1-3 months              |
| Immediate seat change | Potentially immediate   |
| Non-pilot position    | Potentially immediate   |

### CA SDI Filing Is Independent

::callout{type="warning" title="File CA SDI Early"}
**Do NOT wait for LTD eligibility to file for CA SDI.** File CA SDI as soon as your disability begins, regardless of when LTD will start.
::

CA SDI has:

- 7-day waiting period
- 49-day filing deadline
- 52-week maximum duration

LTD eligibility may not occur until months into your disability.

## Calculating Your LTD Eligibility Date

### Step 1: Check Your Sick Banks

1. Log into Workday
2. Navigate to Benefits → Time Off
3. Note balances for:
   - Regular sick time
   - DSA (Disability Sick Absence)

### Step 2: Calculate Burn Rate

**Full-time disability:** 8 hours per scheduled workday

**Partial disability:** Varies based on hours worked

**Example calculation:**

```
Regular sick: 200 hours ÷ 8 hours/day = 25 days
DSA:          400 hours ÷ 8 hours/day = 50 days
Total:        600 hours ÷ 8 hours/day = 75 days

Expected LTD start: 75 days after disability begins
```

### Step 3: Plan for Gaps

**Between sick exhaustion and first LTD payment:**

- Processing time: 2-4 weeks typical
- First payment: Usually 2-4 weeks after approval

**Financial bridge:**

- Ensure adequate savings
- CA SDI may help bridge the gap
- Consider emergency funds

## Interaction with CA SDI

### Timeline Example

```
Day 1:       Disability begins
Day 1-7:     CA SDI waiting period
Day 8:       CA SDI payments can begin (if approved)
Day 75:      Sick banks exhausted → LTD eligible
Day 90:      LTD claim approved
Day 104:     First LTD payment received
```

### Key Points

1. **File CA SDI immediately** - Don't wait for sick banks to exhaust
2. **CA SDI continues** - Even after LTD begins (up to 52 weeks total)
3. **Offset applies** - LTD will offset CA SDI payments
4. **Different systems** - EDD and LTD administrator operate independently

## Special Situations

### Seat Change Mid-Disability

If you're on disability and then bid to a lower seat:

1. Becomes LTD eligibility trigger immediately
2. Even if you still have sick banks
3. Must be disability-related, not preference

**Example:**

```
Day 1:   Captain becomes disabled
Day 30:  Still on sick banks
Day 60:  Bids to First Officer due to medical restrictions
Day 60:  Now LTD eligible (despite remaining sick time)
```

### Return to Work Attempts

If you return to work but then go back on disability:

- New eligibility evaluation may be required
- Sick banks may have partially replenished
- Consult with benefits administrator

### Part-Time Disability

If working reduced schedule:

- Sick banks burn slower
- LTD eligibility delayed
- May still qualify for partial CA SDI

## Documentation to Maintain

Keep records of:

- **Sick bank statements** - Monthly screenshots from Workday
- **Medical documentation** - All restrictions and limitations
- **Bid records** - If seat changes occur
- **Communication logs** - All contacts with benefits administrators

## Next Steps

Once you determine your LTD eligibility date:

1. **File LTD claim** 30-60 days before eligibility date
2. **Verify administrator** - Hartford (see [Contacts](/contacts))
3. **Understand calculations** - Review [benefit calculations](/guide/hartford/calculation)
4. **Learn about offsets** - Study [offset rules](/guide/hartford/offsets)
