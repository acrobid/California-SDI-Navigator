# How the LTD Offset Is Calculated

Understanding the offset calculation is crucial for knowing what you'll actually receive.

::callout{type="info" title="Comprehensive Offset Guide Available"}
For complete details on **all offset types** (CA SDI, SSDI with 70% rule, and outside income), see the [comprehensive LTD Offsets guide](/guide/hartford/offsets). This page provides a simplified overview.
::

## The Basic Concept

The LTD administrator reduces your LTD payment by the amount of "other income" you receive, including SDI.

::callout{type="warning" title="This Is The Core Problem"}
You pay California SDI tax on your full earnings. But the administrator reduces your LTD by that same SDI amount. You're effectively paying for a benefit that doesn't increase your total income.
::

## Step-by-Step Calculation

### Step 1: Calculate Gross LTD Benefit

```
Pre-disability earnings: $350,000 (capped at IRS limit)
LTD percentage: 60% (first 24 months)
Gross monthly LTD: $350,000 × 60% ÷ 12 = $17,500
```

**Note:** Percentage drops to 50% after 24 months. See [Benefit Calculation](/guide/hartford/calculation) for details.

### Step 2: Determine SDI Weekly Benefit

```
Highest quarterly earnings: $87,500
Weekly benefit: ~60-70% of highest weekly wage
Maximum weekly SDI: $1,765 (2026)
Monthly SDI: $1,765 × 4.33 = ~$7,642
```

### Step 3: Apply the Offset

```
Gross LTD benefit:       $17,500/month
Less: SDI offset:        -$7,642/month
Net LTD payment:         $9,858/month
```

### Your Total Income

```
SDI payment:             $7,015/month
Net LTD payment:         $12,431/month
Total monthly income:    $19,446/month
```

The total is the same whether you receive SDI or not. This is the offset problem.

## What Counts as Offset Income

Hartford offsets your LTD benefit by:

| Income Source | Offset? |
|--------------|---------|
| California SDI | Yes |
| Social Security Disability | Yes |
| Workers' Compensation | Yes |
| Other state disability | Yes |
| Retirement pension | Sometimes |
| Investment income | No |
| Spouse's income | No |

## Detailed Offset Example

### Pilot Scenario

**Assumptions:**
- Annual earnings: $400,000
- LTD cap: $350,000 (IRS limit)
- SDI weekly max: $1,620 (2026)

**Monthly Calculation:**

| Line Item | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Earnings (capped at $350K) | $350,000/year |
| LTD rate | 66.67% |
| Gross annual LTD | $233,345 |
| Gross monthly LTD | $19,446 |
| SDI monthly (max) | $7,015 |
| **Net LTD payment** | **$12,431** |

**What You Receive:**
- From SDI: $7,015/month
- From Hartford: $12,431/month
- **Total: $19,446/month**

### What If You Didn't Get SDI?

**Without SDI:**
- From SDI: $0
- From Hartford: $19,446/month
- **Total: $19,446/month**

::callout{type="danger" title="Same Total Either Way"}
Whether you receive SDI or not, your total income is the same. But you're still paying SDI tax—that's money you'll never see benefit from.
::

## The SDI Tax Cost

### What You Pay

**2026 SDI Tax:**
- Rate: 1.3% (uncapped)
- On $400,000 earnings: $5,200/year

### What You "Get"

**SDI Benefit:**
- $7,015/month while disabled
- BUT: Hartford offsets this amount

**Net Value: $0**

You pay $5,200/year for SDI tax, but due to offset, it doesn't increase your actual disability income.

## Policy Language

The Hartford policy typically states something like:

> "Monthly benefit will be reduced by Other Income Benefits, including but not limited to state disability benefits..."

The specific language matters. Request your complete policy to review exact offset provisions.

## Fighting the Offset

### Options Are Limited

The offset is a policy provision, not a Hartford error. However:

1. **Verify the calculation** - Ensure Hartford calculated correctly
2. **Check policy language** - Look for any exceptions
3. **Consider PBRB** - For calculation disputes
4. **Advocate for change** - Through union for future policies

### When Hartford Makes Errors

Hartford may miscalculate if:
- Wrong SDI amount used
- Incorrect timing of offset application
- Misunderstanding of when SDI pays

If you believe there's an error:
1. Request detailed calculation
2. Compare to actual SDI payments
3. Dispute in writing
4. Escalate as needed

## Estimating Your Offset

Use our [Calculator](/calculator) to estimate:
- Your expected SDI weekly benefit
- Your expected LTD monthly benefit
- The offset amount
- Your total expected income

## Timing of Offsets

### When Offsets Apply

**During LTD elimination period (Days 1-180):**
- No LTD payments
- No offset (nothing to offset from)
- SDI pays independently

**After LTD begins (Day 181+):**
- LTD payments begin
- Offset applies to each payment
- Monthly reconciliation may occur

### If SDI Ends Before LTD

SDI maximum duration is typically 52 weeks. LTD can continue longer.

```
Months 1-12:  SDI + LTD (offset applied)
Months 13+:   LTD only (no offset, full LTD amount)
```
