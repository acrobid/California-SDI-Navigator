# LTD Cooperation Requirements

Your continued eligibility for LTD benefits depends on meeting specific cooperation requirements. Failure to cooperate can result in suspension or termination of your benefits.

## CBA Requirements (Section 27.J.4)

According to the Collective Bargaining Agreement:

> "In order for a pilot to continue to be eligible for a disability benefit under the LTD Plan, the pilot must fully cooperate with the Claims Paying Administrator, in coordination with the Aeromedical Advisor, and must diligently seek restoration of any required license or medical certificate to allow the pilot to return to work."

This establishes **three core requirements**:

1. Cooperate with Claims Paying Administrator
2. Coordinate with Aeromedical Advisor
3. Diligently seek medical certificate restoration

## 1. Cooperate with Claims Paying Administrator

### What "Full Cooperation" Means

You must:

- **Respond promptly** to all information requests
- **Provide complete information** when asked
- **Submit to examinations** when reasonably requested
- **Allow access** to medical records (with proper authorization)
- **Report changes** in your condition or circumstances
- **Attend appointments** scheduled by the administrator

### Typical Requests You'll Receive

**Regular updates (every 30-90 days):**
- Current medical status
- Treatment received
- Changes in condition
- Work status
- Other income sources

**Medical documentation:**

- Must attend unless medically contraindicated
- Doctor will evaluate your condition and restrictions

**Functional Capacity Evaluations (FCEs):**
- Physical testing of your abilities
- Typically conducted by occupational therapist

### How to Cooperate Effectively

**Best practices:**

1. **Keep a log** of all communications
   - Date and time
   - Person contacted
   - Summary of discussion
   - Follow-up items

2. **Respond in writing** when possible
   - Creates documentation
   - Allows you to be thorough
   - Provides proof of compliance

3. **Meet deadlines**
   - Set calendar reminders
   - Don't wait until last day
   - Request extensions if needed (before deadline)

4. **Be thorough but concise**
   - Answer all questions asked
   - Don't volunteer unnecessary information
   - Stick to medical facts

5. **Keep copies of everything**
   - All forms submitted
   - All letters received
   - All medical records sent

## 2. Coordinate with Aeromedical Advisor

### Who Is the Aeromedical Advisor?

The Aeromedical Advisor is:
- A physician employed by or contracted with FedEx
- Specializes in aviation medicine
- Advises on return-to-work planning
- Coordinates with FAA on medical certification issues

### Your Responsibilities

**You must:**

- Respond to Aeromedical Advisor requests
- Attend appointments when scheduled
- Provide medical records as requested
- Discuss your medical certification path
- Follow reasonable recommendations

**You do NOT have to:**
- Accept the Aeromedical Advisor as your treating physician
- Follow treatment recommendations from Aeromedical Advisor
- Disclose information beyond what's relevant to work capacity

### Typical Interactions

**Initial contact:**
- Usually occurs early in disability
- Review of medical condition
- Discussion of prognosis
- Identification of barriers to return to work

**Ongoing coordination:**
- Updates on medical status
- Discussion of treatment progress
- Planning for medical certification
- Identification of work restrictions

**Return-to-work planning:**
- Assessment of work capacity
- Discussion of accommodations
- Coordination with flight operations
- FAA medical certification strategy

### Protecting Your Interests

While cooperating:

1. **Understand the role** - Aeromedical Advisor works for FedEx, not for you
2. **Have your own doctor** - Maintain independent medical care
3. **Know your rights** - You can decline treatment recommendations
4. **Document everything** - Keep records of all interactions
5. **Seek second opinions** - If medical opinions differ significantly

**Consider ALPA assistance:**
- ALPA Aeromedical Office can advise you
- ALPA can help navigate FAA certification
- ALPA R&I committee can address disputes

## 3. Diligently Seek Medical Certificate Restoration

### What "Diligent Effort" Means

You must **actively work** toward restoring your FAA medical certificate when it is possible to do so.

**Required efforts:**

- **Comply with treatment** recommended by your treating physicians
- **Follow up with specialists** as needed
- **Work with AMEs** (Aviation Medical Examiners) on certification path
- **Pursue FAA Special Issuance** if available
- **Engage with HIMS** if substance-related issue
- **Document all efforts** made toward certification

### When This Applies

**You must seek restoration if:**
- Your condition is potentially improvable
- Treatment options are available
- FAA certification pathways exist
- Your disability may be temporary

**You are NOT required to:**
- Undergo high-risk experimental treatments
- Accept treatments that contradict your doctor's advice
- Pursue certification if condition is permanent and untreatable

### What Counts as "Diligent Effort"

**Examples of compliance:**

✅ Attending all scheduled doctor appointments
✅ Following prescribed treatment plans
✅ Taking medications as prescribed
✅ Completing physical therapy
✅ Meeting with AME to discuss certification path
✅ Submitting FAA Special Issuance applications
✅ Gathering required medical documentation
✅ Participating in HIMS program (if applicable)
✅ Consulting with specialists as recommended

**Examples of non-compliance:**

❌ Missing medical appointments without cause
❌ Refusing recommended treatment without valid reason
❌ Not taking prescribed medications
❌ Failing to follow up with specialists
❌ Not engaging with AME or FAA process
❌ Refusing to provide medical documentation

### Documenting Your Efforts

**Keep records of:**

- All medical appointments (dates, providers, purpose)
- Treatment compliance (medications, therapy, etc.)
- AME consultations and recommendations
- FAA correspondence and applications
- Specialist evaluations
- HIMS participation (if applicable)

**Why documentation matters:**
- Proves you're meeting requirements
- Protects against benefit termination
- Supports appeals if benefits are denied
- Demonstrates good faith effort

### Special Situations

**Condition is permanent:**
- Provide medical documentation showing permanence
- May not be required to pursue certification
- Focus on managing condition and quality of life

**Multiple treatment options:**
- Must pursue reasonable options
- Can choose among equivalent treatments
- Can decline high-risk or experimental treatments

**Financial barriers:**
- Medical costs typically covered by insurance
- Administrator may assist with certification costs
- Contact ALPA if financial issues prevent compliance

---

## Consequences of Non-Cooperation

### Benefit Suspension

**First consequence:**
- Administrator sends warning letter
- Specifies what's needed
- Provides deadline to comply
- Benefits may continue pending response

### Benefit Termination

**If non-cooperation continues:**
- Benefits terminated
- Must appeal to restore
- Burden on you to prove cooperation
- May lose benefits permanently

### Repayment Requirements

**In some cases:**
- May be required to repay benefits received
- Especially if non-cooperation was fraudulent
- Can create significant financial hardship

---

## Your Rights

While you must cooperate, you also have rights:

### You Can:

- **Question requests** that seem unreasonable
- **Request clarification** of requirements
- **Seek extensions** when needed
- **Refuse unreasonable demands**
- **Appeal adverse decisions**
- **Get ALPA representation**

### You Cannot Be Required To:

- Accept specific medical treatment against your will
- See specific doctors (beyond IMEs)
- Disclose information unrelated to work capacity
- Travel excessive distances without accommodation
- Take actions that violate your doctor's orders
