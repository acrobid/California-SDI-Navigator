# When Hartford LTD Begins

Understanding when Long-Term Disability (LTD) kicks in is essential for financial planning during your disability.

## The Waiting Period

### 180-Day Elimination Period

Hartford LTD has a **180-day elimination period** (also called "waiting period"):

```
Day 1-180:   Elimination period (no LTD payments)
Day 181:     LTD benefits begin (if approved)
```

::callout{type="info" title="Six Full Months"}
180 days = approximately 6 months. During this time, you rely on sick banks and SDI.
::

### What the 180 Days Means

- You must be continuously disabled for 180 days
- LTD does not pay during this period
- Your sick banks and SDI cover this time
- Day 181 is when LTD payments can start

### Counting the Days

**Day 1 starts:**
- The first day you cannot work due to disability
- Usually the day after your last day worked

**Days continue if:**
- You remain disabled
- You don't return to work
- Your doctor continues to certify disability

## LTD vs. SDI Timing

### Overlap and Coordination

| Period | SDI Status | LTD Status |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Days 1-7 | Waiting period | Elimination period |
| Days 8-180 | Paying | Elimination period |
| Days 181+ | May continue | Now paying |

### How They Work Together

1. **Months 1-6:** SDI is your primary income (plus sick banks)
2. **Month 7+:** LTD begins, SDI may continue
3. **Offset applies:** LTD reduces payment by SDI amount

This is where the [offset problem](/guide/overview/offset-problem) becomes critical.

## Qualifying for LTD

### Own Occupation Period

For the first **24 months** of LTD benefits:

- Disabled means unable to perform your **own occupation**
- For pilots: unable to fly as a pilot
- Any restriction preventing flight qualifies

### Any Occupation Period

After 24 months:

- Disabled means unable to perform **any occupation**
- More restrictive standard
- Must be unable to do any work you're qualified for

::callout{type="warning" title="Different Standards"}
You might qualify during the "own occupation" period but not the "any occupation" period. Plan accordingly.

## Your LTD Policy Details

### Benefit Amount

Hartford LTD pays:
- **66.67%** of your pre-disability earnings
- Subject to IRS 401(a)(17) limit ($350,000 for 2026)
- Reduced by other income (SDI, other disability payments)

**Maximum Monthly Benefit Calculation:**
```
$350,000 × 66.67% ÷ 12 = $19,446/month (before offsets)
```

### Taxability

Hartford premiums are employer-paid, so:
- LTD benefits are taxable income
- Federal income tax applies
- State income tax may apply

## Planning for the Transition

### Financial Timeline

```
Months 1-6:  Sick banks + SDI
Month 7+:    LTD + possibly SDI
```

### Key Considerations

1. **Cash flow gap:** Ensure you can cover first 180 days
2. **First LTD payment:** May take additional processing time
3. **Offset impact:** LTD payment will be reduced by SDI

### Documenting for Hartford

Keep records of:
- All SDI payments received
- Sick bank usage
- Any other disability income
- Medical treatment and documentation

Hartford will ask for this information and verify it.

## Common LTD Issues

- Review denial reason carefully
- You have **180 days** to appeal
- Gather additional medical evidence
- Consider legal representation

### Delayed Approval

If approval takes too long:
