## Reasons to Appeal

### Claim Denial

Hartford may deny your claim for:
- Not meeting definition of "disabled"
- Pre-existing condition exclusion
- Missing documentation
- Alleged misrepresentation

### Benefit Calculation

You might dispute:
- Incorrect salary used in calculation
- Wrong offset amount
- Improper application of policy terms
- Mathematical errors

### Other Issues

- Benefits terminated too early
- Retroactive denial
- Change from "own occupation" to "any occupation"

## The 180-Day Deadline

::callout{type="danger" title="Critical Deadline"}
You have **180 days** from the date of denial to appeal. This deadline is set by ERISA (federal law) and is strictly enforced.

## Strengthening Your Appeal

### Medical Evidence

The most important factor in disability appeals:

1. **Detailed physician statement**
   - Specific diagnosis
   - Objective findings
   - Functional limitations
   - Why you cannot work

2. **Medical records**
   - Test results
   - Treatment notes
   - Hospital records

3. **Specialist reports**
   - Relevant specialists
   - Second opinions

### Pilot-Specific Arguments

For pilots, emphasize:
- No "light duty" or modified work possible
- FAA medical requirements
- Any restriction grounds ALL flying
- "Own occupation" means airline pilot specifically

### Expert Opinions

Consider obtaining:
- Independent medical examination
- Vocational expert opinion
- Legal opinion on policy interpretation

## After Submitting

### Timeline

Hartford has **45 days** to decide your appeal:
- May extend to 90 days with notice
- Must provide written decision
- Must explain if denied again

### If Appeal Approved

- Benefits should begin promptly
- Retroactive benefits may be owed
- Document everything

### If Appeal Denied

You have two options:
1. **ERISA lawsuit** in federal court
2. **PBRB process** (for FedEx pilots)

## Getting Help

### Legal Representation

For complex appeals, consider an attorney:
- ERISA experience is essential
- Many work on contingency
- Can significantly improve outcomes

### ALPA Resources

The union may provide:
- General guidance
- Referrals to experienced attorneys
- Peer support from pilots who've navigated this

## Common Appeal Mistakes

### Avoid These Errors

1. **Missing deadline** - Mark it on calendar immediately
2. **Weak medical evidence** - Get detailed doctor statements
3. **Not reviewing file** - Request and review complete file
4. **Generic arguments** - Address specific denial reasons
5. **Waiting too long** - Start gathering evidence immediately

## ERISA Litigation

If your appeal is denied, you can sue in federal court.

### Key Points

- Must exhaust administrative remedies first (appeals)
- Limited to evidence in your claim file (mostly)
- Court reviews Hartford's decision, not fresh review
- Experienced ERISA attorney strongly recommended

### Time Limits

Varies by plan, typically 2-3 years from final denial. Check your policy.
