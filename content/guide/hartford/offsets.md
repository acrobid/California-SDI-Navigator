# LTD Benefit Offsets

Your gross LTD benefit is reduced by other income sources. Understanding these offset rules is critical for accurate financial planning.

## Overview of Offsets

Your **net LTD payment** equals:

```
Gross LTD Benefit
  - CA SDI offset
  - SSDI offset (70% rule)
  - Outside income offset (if applicable)
  = Net LTD Payment
```

Each offset type has different rules. Let's explore each one.

---

## CA SDI Offset

### Basic Rule

**CA SDI is fully offset** from your LTD benefit.

**Example:**
```
Gross LTD:      $9,000/month
CA SDI:         $1,681/week × 4.33 = $7,279/month
Net LTD:        $9,000 - $7,279 = $1,721/month
```

### Critical Problem: The Offset Paradox

See the [Offset Problem](/guide/overview/offset-problem) guide for a complete explanation of why CA pilots face a unique financial trap.

**Key points:**
- CA SDI is offset **whether or not you've received payment**
- LTD administrator uses **expected** CA SDI, not actual
- EDD delays mean you may get neither full SDI nor full LTD
- This is the core problem this guide helps you navigate

### When CA SDI Offset Applies

**Immediately upon LTD eligibility**, the administrator will:

1. Calculate your **expected** CA SDI benefit
2. Offset that amount from your LTD
3. This happens even if:
   - You haven't filed for CA SDI yet
   - Your CA SDI claim is pending
   - EDD denied your claim
   - You never receive CA SDI

### Proving CA SDI Status

To reduce or eliminate the CA SDI offset, you must provide:

- **Denial letter** from EDD (if denied)
- **Approval letter** showing actual benefit amount
- **Payment history** showing what you actually received
- **Exhaustion notice** if you've used all 52 weeks

::callout{type="warning" title="Documentation Is Critical"}
Without documentation from EDD, the administrator will assume maximum CA SDI and offset accordingly.

## SSDI Offset (CBA Section 27.J.15)

### The 70% Rule

**Only 70% of your SSDI is offset**, not 100%.

This is a significant benefit to pilots whose disability began after October 30, 2006.

**Example:**
```
Your SSDI benefit:    $3,000/month
Amount offset:        $3,000 × 70% = $2,100/month
You effectively keep: $3,000 × 30% = $900/month "free"
```

### Why This Matters

If you're receiving both LTD and SSDI:

**Without 70% rule (100% offset):**
```
Gross LTD:    $9,000
SSDI offset:  -$3,000 (100%)
Net benefit:  $6,000
Total income: $6,000 + $3,000 = $9,000
```

**With 70% rule (actual):**
```
Gross LTD:    $9,000
SSDI offset:  -$2,100 (70%)
Net LTD:      $6,900
Total income: $6,900 + $3,000 = $9,900
```

**You keep an extra $900/month.**

### Family Benefits Excluded

If SSDI pays additional amounts for your dependents:

- **Spouse benefits:** NOT offset
- **Children benefits:** NOT offset
- **Only YOUR benefit** is subject to the 70% offset

**Example:**
```
SSDI breakdown:
  - Your benefit:     $3,000/month
  - Spouse benefit:   $800/month
  - 2 children:       $600/month each
  - Total SSDI:       $5,000/month

LTD offset calculation:
  - Only your $3,000 is considered
  - 70% offset = $3,000 × 0.70 = $2,100
  - Family benefits ($2,000) = ZERO offset

Total income:
  - LTD: $9,000 - $2,100 = $6,900
  - SSDI: $5,000
  - Total: $11,900/month
```

### Legacy Exception

**Disabilities before October 30, 2006:**

- 100% offset applies (old rule)
- No family benefit exclusion

If your disability began before this date, the entire SSDI amount is offset.

### SSDI Application Timeline

**SSDI typically takes:**
- 3-6 months for initial decision
- 12-24 months if appeals are needed
- Retroactive payments when approved

**During SSDI application:**
- LTD will not offset SSDI (you haven't been approved yet)
- Once approved, offset begins
- Retroactive SSDI may require you to repay LTD overpayments

::callout{type="info" title="Coordinate SSDI Applications"}
Inform your LTD administrator when you apply for SSDI. This helps prevent overpayment issues later.

## Outside Income Offset (CBA Section 27.J.13)

### The Threshold Rule

**Outside income is only offset if your total income exceeds your pre-disability total income.**

This is a **very favorable** rule for pilots with side businesses.

### Pre-Disability Income Includes Outside Income

Your baseline is:
- FedEx pre-disability earnings
- **PLUS** any outside income you had before disability
- Averaged over 12 months

### The 50% Excess Rule

When your current total income exceeds your pre-disability total:
- Offset = **50% of the excess**
- NOT 100% of your outside income

### Example 1: No Offset

**Pre-disability (12-month average):**
```
FedEx income:      $100,000/year = $8,333/month
Side business:     $25,000/year  = $2,083/month
Total baseline:    $125,000/year = $10,416/month
```

**While on LTD:**
```
LTD benefit:       $5,000/month
Side business:     $4,000/month (business continues)
Current total:     $9,000/month
```

**Offset calculation:**
```
Current total:     $9,000/month
Baseline:          $10,416/month
Excess:            $0 (current is less than baseline)
Offset:            $0
```

**Result:** No offset. You keep full LTD and all outside income.

### Example 2: With Offset

**Same pre-disability baseline:** $10,416/month

**While on LTD (business grows):**
```
LTD benefit:       $5,000/month
Side business:     $7,000/month (business grew)
Current total:     $12,000/month
```

**Offset calculation:**
```
Current total:     $12,000/month
Baseline:          $10,416/month
Excess:            $1,584/month
Offset:            $1,584 × 50% = $792/month
```

**Net LTD payment:**
```
Gross LTD:         $5,000
Outside offset:    -$792
Net LTD:           $4,208
```

**Total income:**
```
Net LTD:           $4,208
Side business:     $7,000
Total:             $11,208/month
```

### Key Points

1. **Baseline includes your outside income** - Don't abandon your side business thinking it will hurt you
2. **Only excess is offset** - Not your full outside income
3. **50% rate** - You keep half of any excess
4. **Encourages productivity** - System rewards working when able

### What Counts as Outside Income

**Included:**
- Self-employment income
- Consulting fees
- Business profits
- Rental income (active involvement)
- Part-time employment

**Typically excluded:**
- Passive investment income
- Capital gains
- Rental income (passive)
- Inheritance
- VA disability (separate rules)

### Documentation Requirements

You must report to LTD administrator:

- All sources of outside income
- Monthly or annual amounts
- Business tax returns if self-employed
- 1099 forms for contract work

**Failure to report:**
- May result in benefit suspension
- May require repayment of overpayments
- May be considered fraud

## Combined Offset Example

### High-Earning Captain with Multiple Income Sources

**Pre-disability:**
```
FedEx income:      $300,000/year = $25,000/month
Real estate:       $36,000/year  = $3,000/month
Total baseline:    $28,000/month
```

**Month 10 of disability:**
```
Gross LTD:         $16,800/month (60% of $28,000)
CA SDI:            $7,279/month (expected)
SSDI:              Not yet approved
Real estate:       $3,000/month (continues)
```

**Offset calculations:**

1. **CA SDI offset:**
   ```
   Full offset: -$7,279
   ```

2. **Outside income offset:**
   ```
   Current LTD + real estate: $16,800 + $3,000 = $19,800
   Baseline: $28,000
   Excess: $0 (current < baseline)
   Offset: $0
   ```

3. **Net LTD:**
   ```
   Gross LTD:           $16,800
   CA SDI offset:       -$7,279
   Outside offset:      -$0
   Net LTD:             $9,521
   ```

4. **Total income:**
   ```
   Net LTD:             $9,521
   Real estate:         $3,000
   Total:               $12,521/month
   ```

**Later (Month 16), SSDI approved retroactively:**

```
SSDI approved:       $3,500/month (pilot portion)
SSDI family:         $1,200/month (spouse + children)

New offset calculation:

CA SDI offset:       -$7,279 (if still within 52 weeks)
SSDI offset:         -$2,450 ($3,500 × 70%)
Outside offset:      -$0 (still below baseline)

Net LTD:             $16,800 - $7,279 - $2,450 = $7,071

Total income:
  Net LTD:           $7,071
  SSDI (total):      $4,700 ($3,500 + $1,200)
  Real estate:       $3,000
  Total:             $14,771/month
```

## Strategies for Managing Offsets

### 1. File CA SDI Promptly

- Minimizes the "neither SDI nor LTD" gap
- Documents your actual benefit amount
- Provides proof for offset calculation

### 2. Apply for SSDI Early

- Long approval process
- 70% offset is favorable
- Family benefits not offset

### 3. Maintain Outside Income Records

- Document pre-disability income carefully
- Keep 12 months of records before disability
- Report all income honestly to avoid problems

### 4. Understand the Timeline

```
Months 1-6:    CA SDI only (if approved), no LTD yet
Month 7-12:    LTD begins, CA SDI continues, full CA SDI offset
Month 13+:     CA SDI exhausted (52 weeks), only LTD
               SSDI approved, 70% SSDI offset begins
Month 25+:     LTD drops to 50%, lower gross benefit
```

### 5. Challenge Incorrect Offsets

If you believe an offset is calculated incorrectly:

1. Request detailed calculation in writing
2. Provide documentation supporting your position
3. Reference specific CBA sections
4. Use PBRB process if needed

## Common Questions

### Q: What if CA SDI denies my claim?

Provide the denial letter to your LTD administrator. They should remove or reduce the CA SDI offset.

### Q: What if I receive less CA SDI than expected?

Provide your approval letter and payment history. The offset should be based on **actual** CA SDI received, not estimated maximum.

### Q: Can I work part-time while on LTD?

Yes, but:
- Must still meet disability definition
- Income affects outside income offset
- Coordinate with both EDD and LTD administrator

### Q: What about VA disability payments?

**VA disability is typically NOT offset** from LTD benefits because:
- VA benefits are compensation for service-connected disabilities
- They are not "disability income" in the traditional sense
- Most LTD plans exclude VA benefits from offsets

**However:**
- Verify with your specific LTD administrator
- Review your actual plan documents
- VA benefits may affect SSDI eligibility/amount
- Some plans have specific VA offset provisions

**Action:** Contact your LTD administrator at the start of your claim to confirm VA benefit treatment.
