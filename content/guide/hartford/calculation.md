# LTD Benefit Calculation

Understanding how your Long-Term Disability benefit is calculated helps you plan financially and verify that you're receiving the correct amount.

## Overview (CBA Section 27.J.2, 27.J.6, 27.J.7)

Your LTD benefit is based on:

1. **Your monthly earnings** (special calculation method)
2. **Benefit percentage** (varies by time on LTD)
3. **IRS 401(a)(17) cap** (maximum benefit limit)

## Monthly Earnings Definition

### The "Best 12 of 36" Rule (CBA 27.J.6)

Your **monthly earnings** are calculated as:

> "The 12 highest consecutive months out of the 36 consecutive months preceding the disability period"

This is **more favorable** than simply using your last month's pay or a 12-month average.

### Why This Matters

If you had a particularly good 12-month stretch within the last 3 years, that's what counts for your LTD calculation.

**Example:**
```
Last 36 months included:
- Months 1-12:   Average $15,000/month (peak flying schedule)
- Months 13-24:  Average $13,500/month (training, less flying)
- Months 25-36:  Average $14,000/month (moderate schedule)

Your monthly earnings = $15,000 (best 12 consecutive months)
NOT $14,166 (average of all 36 months)
```

### What's Included in "Monthly Earnings"

**Basic monthly compensation includes:**
- Base pay
- Flight pay
- Override pay
- Premium pay
- Per diem

**Typically EXCLUDES:**
- Vacation pay (unless part of regular pay structure)
- One-time bonuses
- Reimbursements
- Non-regular compensation

Request a detailed calculation from your LTD administrator showing which 12 months they used.

## Benefit Percentages

### First 24 Months: 60% (CBA 27.J.2)

For your **first 24 months** on LTD:

```
Monthly Benefit = Monthly Earnings × 60%
```

**Example:**
```
Monthly earnings: $15,000
Benefit: $15,000 × 60% = $9,000/month (before offsets)
```

### After 24 Months: 50% (CBA 27.J.2)

After **24 months** on LTD:

```
Monthly Benefit = Monthly Earnings × 50%
```

**Example:**
```
Monthly earnings: $15,000
Benefit: $15,000 × 50% = $7,500/month (before offsets)
```

### Why the Reduction?

The reduction from 60% to 50% after 24 months:
- Encourages return to work when possible
- Reflects standard industry practice
- Is specified in the CBA

::callout{type="warning" title="Plan for the Reduction"}
If your disability extends beyond 24 months, expect a 16.7% reduction in your gross LTD benefit at the 24-month mark.

## IRS 401(a)(17) Cap

### Maximum Benefit Limits (CBA 27.J.7)

The IRS imposes an annual compensation limit on qualified plans. This caps your maximum LTD benefit.

**IRS 401(a)(17) Limits:**

| Year | Annual Limit | Monthly Limit |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024 | $345,000     | $28,750       |
| 2025 | $350,000     | $29,167       |
| 2026 | $350,000     | $29,167       |

### Maximum Monthly Benefits

**Months 1-24 (60% of cap):**

| Year | Maximum Benefit |
|------|-----------------|
| 2024 | $17,250/month   |
| 2025 | $17,500/month   |
| 2026 | $17,500/month   |

**Months 25+ (50% of cap):**

| Year | Maximum Benefit |
|------|-----------------|
| 2024 | $14,375/month   |
| 2025 | $14,583/month   |
| 2026 | $14,583/month   |

### How the Cap Works

Your benefit is the **lesser of**:

1. Your calculated benefit (monthly earnings × percentage)
2. The IRS 401(a)(17) cap

**Example 1: Below the cap**
```
Monthly earnings: $15,000
Percentage: 60% (first 24 months)
Calculated: $15,000 × 60% = $9,000
Cap: $17,500
Actual benefit: $9,000 (lower amount)
```

**Example 2: Above the cap**
```
Monthly earnings: $32,000
Percentage: 60% (first 24 months)
Calculated: $32,000 × 60% = $19,200
Cap: $17,500
Actual benefit: $17,500 (capped)
```

## Complete Calculation Example

### High-Earning Captain

**Background:**
- Best 12 consecutive months: Average $28,000/month
- Currently in month 10 of disability
- 2026 benefit year

**Calculation:**

```
Step 1: Monthly earnings = $28,000 (best 12 of 36)

Step 2: Apply percentage
        Month 10 = within first 24 months = 60%
        $28,000 × 60% = $16,800

Step 3: Check cap
        2026 cap (months 1-24) = $17,500
        $16,800 < $17,500 ✓ Not capped

Gross monthly benefit: $16,800
```

**Note:** This is BEFORE offsets (CA SDI, SSDI, outside income).

### First Officer Example

**Background:**
- Best 12 consecutive months: Average $12,000/month
- Currently in month 30 of disability
- 2026 benefit year

**Calculation:**

```
Step 1: Monthly earnings = $12,000

Step 2: Apply percentage
        Month 30 = after 24 months = 50%
        $12,000 × 50% = $6,000

Step 3: Check cap
        2026 cap (months 25+) = $14,583
        $6,000 < $14,583 ✓ Not capped

Gross monthly benefit: $6,000
```

## Verifying Your Benefit

### Request Detailed Calculation

When you receive your first LTD payment, request:

1. **Which 12 months** were used for your monthly earnings
2. **Calculation breakdown** showing:
   - Monthly earnings amount
   - Percentage applied
   - Any cap applied
   - All offsets applied
3. **Supporting documentation** from payroll records

### Common Errors

Watch for:

- **Wrong months used** - Verify they used your best 12 consecutive
- **Incorrect percentage** - 60% vs 50% based on time on LTD
- **Wrong cap applied** - Verify correct year and timeframe
- **Missing earnings components** - Ensure all eligible pay included

### How to Challenge

If you believe the calculation is wrong:

1. **Document your concern** in writing
2. **Show your calculation** with supporting pay stubs
3. **Request recalculation** from administrator
4. **Escalate if needed** through PBRB process

## Impact of Returning to Work

### Trial Work Period

If you return to work temporarily:

- Your monthly earnings calculation may be reevaluated
- Your benefit percentage continues based on total time on LTD
- Coordinate with administrator before returning

### Partial Return

If you return part-time:

- You may receive partial LTD
- Earnings from part-time work may affect your benefit
- See [Outside Income rules](/guide/hartford/offsets#outside-income)

## Adjustments Over Time

### Annual Updates

- **IRS 401(a)(17) cap** may increase annually with IRS updates
- Your benefit may increase if cap increases
- Administrator should notify you of any changes

### Recalculation Triggers

Your benefit may be recalculated if:

- You return to work and then go back on disability
- There's a correction to your earnings history
- Cap changes significantly
- CBA amendments change calculation method
