# LTD Duration Limits

Not all disabilities have the same maximum benefit duration. Understanding the limits for your specific condition type is essential for long-term financial planning.

## Duration by Condition Type

The CBA establishes different maximum benefit periods depending on your diagnosis:

| Condition Type | Maximum Duration | Notes |
|----------------|------------------|-------|
| **General Physical** | Until recovery or age 65 | No fixed time limit |
| **Mental Health** | 60 months | 5 years maximum |
| **Substance Abuse** | 18 months | 12 base + 6 recertification |
| **Substance Abuse (Legacy)** | 26 weeks | For disabilities before Nov 2, 2015 |

---

## General Physical Disabilities

### Duration (CBA Section 27.J.2)

**Benefits continue until:**

1. You recover and return to work, **OR**
2. You reach **age 65**

**No fixed time limit** for most physical conditions.

### Examples of General Physical Disabilities

- Back injuries
- Heart conditions
- Cancer
- Neurological disorders (non-mental)
- Orthopedic injuries
- Most FAA-disqualifying medical conditions

### What "Until Recovery" Means

Benefits continue as long as:
- You meet the disability definition
- You're unable to perform your occupation (first 24 months)
- You're unable to perform any occupation (after 24 months)
- You're under active medical care
- You meet cooperation requirements

::callout{type="info" title="Most Pilot Disabilities"}
Most medical conditions that prevent pilots from flying fall into this category and have no fixed time limit before age 65.
::

### Age 65 Limit

**Why age 65?**
- Standard retirement age for many plans
- Social Security full retirement age (for many)
- CBA-specified end point

**At age 65:**
- LTD benefits cease
- Medicare becomes available
- Social Security retirement benefits begin
- May have pension benefits

**Planning for age 65:**
- Ensure Social Security is in order
- Review Medicare enrollment
- Confirm pension benefits
- Consider supplemental insurance

## Mental Health Conditions

### 60-Month Maximum (CBA Section 27.J.10)

**Duration:** Maximum of **60 months** (5 years)

> "The duration of the LTD Plan benefits for mental disorders, as currently defined in the LTD Plan, shall remain at a maximum of 60 months."

### What Qualifies as "Mental Disorder"

The LTD Plan document defines mental disorders. Typically includes:

**Commonly included:**
- Depression
- Anxiety disorders
- Bipolar disorder
- Schizophrenia
- Personality disorders
- PTSD (if primary diagnosis)
- Eating disorders
- Other DSM-defined mental illnesses

**May be excluded:**
- Dementia (often treated as physical/neurological)
- Brain injury (physical cause)
- Neurological disorders with psychiatric symptoms

::callout{type="warning" title="Check Your Diagnosis"}
The specific classification of your condition matters. A condition with both physical and mental components may be classified either way.
::

### After 60 Months

**Benefits end even if:**
- You remain disabled
- You're still unable to work
- You haven't recovered

**Options after 60 months:**
- Social Security Disability (if eligible)
- ALPA supplemental disability (if applicable)
- Personal disability insurance (if you have it)
- Return to work if able

### Mixed Diagnoses

**If you have both physical and mental conditions:**

The administrator will determine:
- Which is the **primary** disabling condition
- Whether the 60-month limit applies

**Example scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Mental health primary**
```
Diagnoses: Depression (primary) + back pain (secondary)
Duration: 60-month limit applies
```

**Scenario 2: Physical primary**
```
Diagnoses: Back injury (primary) + depression (secondary)
Duration: No fixed limit (until recovery or age 65)
```

**Scenario 3: Sequential conditions**
```
Years 1-3: Back injury (physical)
Year 4: Depression develops
Duration: Depression gets its own 60-month clock
```

### Challenging the Classification

If you believe your condition is wrongly classified as mental health:

1. **Get medical documentation** showing physical basis
2. **Neuropsychological testing** may help
3. **Independent medical evaluation** from specialist
4. **Appeal the classification** through administrator
5. **Use PBRB process** if needed
