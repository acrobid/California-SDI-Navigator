# Documenting Your Income

Having comprehensive income documentation is crucial for a smooth SDI claim. This guide covers what to collect and how to organize it.

## What to Collect

### Pay Stubs (Last 18 Months)

You need pay stubs covering your entire base period plus some buffer:

| Document | Where to Find | Why You Need It |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Pay stubs (18 months) | Workday | Prove quarterly income |
| YTD summaries | Workday | Quick income verification |
| Direct deposit records | Your bank | Backup proof of payment |

::callout{type="warning" title="Access Changes During Disability"}
Your Workday access may change or be limited if you go on extended leave. Download everything you might need BEFORE you become unable to work if possible.
::

### W-2 Forms

Keep your W-2 forms for:
- The current year (when available)
- The previous 2 years

These show:
- Total CA SDI taxes withheld (Box 14)
- Total compensation reported to California
- Verification of employment

### Flight Records (Optional but Helpful)

If you need to prove when you were actually working vs. using sick time:
- PBS bid records
- Actual trip flown records
- Sick time usage records

## How to Organize

### Create a Timeline

Document your work history:

```
Month     | Status         | Income
----------|----------------|--------
Jan 2025  | Full schedule  | $32,000
Feb 2025  | Full schedule  | $28,000
Mar 2025  | Partial sick   | $25,000
Apr 2025  | Full sick time | $18,000
May 2025  | Disability     | $0
```

### Calculate Quarterly Totals

For your base period, calculate:

```
Q1: Jan + Feb + Mar = $____
Q2: Apr + May + Jun = $____
Q3: Jul + Aug + Sep = $____
Q4: Oct + Nov + Dec = $____

Highest Quarter: $____ (this determines your benefit)
```

### Flag Sick Time Usage

Mark any periods where you used sick time. This may be important if EDD asks about:
- When your disability began
- Why income varied
- What was "regular" pay vs. sick pay

## Where to Find Documents

### Workday

1. Log into Workday
2. Navigate to Pay → Pay Statements
3. Download each statement as PDF
4. Save with naming convention: `PayStub_2025-01-15.pdf`

### Direct Access

If you can't access Workday:
1. Contact FedEx Benefits Center
2. Request historical pay information
3. Allow time for processing

### Bank Records

Your bank can provide:
- Direct deposit history
- Payment amounts and dates
- Backup verification

## Creating Summary Documents

Consider creating summary documents that are easy for EDD to understand:
