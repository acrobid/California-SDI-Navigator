## Verification Steps

### Verify Doctor's License

Before you need it:

1. Go to [mbc.ca.gov/breeze](https://mbc.ca.gov/breeze/)
2. Search for your doctor's name
3. Confirm license is active
4. Save the license number

::callout{type="warning" title="License Issues Cause Delays"}
EDD takes 7-10 business days to verify doctor licenses. If there's any issue with the license, it can delay your claim significantly.
