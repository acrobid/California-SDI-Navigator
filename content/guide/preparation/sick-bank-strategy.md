# Sick Bank Strategy

Understanding how to manage your sick banks is crucial for both short-term protection and long-term disability planning.

## Understanding Your Banks

### Regular Sick Bank

- Accrues continuously during employment
- Used for short-term illness
- May have maximum accrual limits

### Disability Sick Absence (DSA) Bank

- Specifically for extended disability periods
- May have different accrual rules
- Often used before LTD kicks in

## The Transition Timeline

```
Phase 1: Sick Bank
↓ (when exhausted)
Phase 2: DSA Bank  
↓ (when exhausted)
Phase 3: LTD Benefits (with SDI offset)
```

You can file for CA SDI during any phase when you're unable to work. You don't have to wait until sick banks are exhausted. In fact, filing early is recommended.

## SDI Filing Timing

### Early Filing Benefits

- Claim processing starts sooner
- Payments may begin when you need them
- 49-day deadline doesn't become a crisis
- More time to resolve any issues

### When SDI Payments Actually Start

SDI has a **7-day waiting period** (no benefits paid for first 7 days of disability). After that:

- If approved, payments begin for the period after the waiting period
- Payments may overlap with or replace sick bank pay
- Coordination depends on timing

## The Hartford Offset Consideration

::callout{type="warning" title="Key Decision Point"}
The Hartford offset only applies to LTD benefits. While you're still using sick banks, there's no LTD to offset.
::

### Optimal Timing Strategy

1. **File SDI early** in your disability
2. **Use sick/DSA banks** while SDI processes
3. **SDI payments begin** (hopefully before LTD starts)
4. **LTD begins** when sick banks exhausted
5. **Offset applies** but you're already receiving SDI

The goal is to have SDI approved and paying **before** you transition to LTD, minimizing the gap where Hartford offsets SDI you haven't received.

## Checking Your Balances

### Where to Find Your Balances

1. **Workday:** Check current balances
2. **Pay stubs:** Often show current accruals
3. **HR:** Can provide historical information

### What to Document

- Current sick bank balance (hours)
- Current DSA bank balance (hours)
- Monthly accrual rate
- Any caps or limits

## Estimating Duration

Calculate how long your banks will last:

```
Total Sick Hours ÷ Monthly Usage Rate = Months of Coverage

Example:
- Sick bank: 480 hours
- DSA bank: 720 hours
- Total: 1,200 hours
- Monthly burn: 168 hours (full month)
- Duration: ~7 months
```

## Strategic Considerations

### If You Have Advance Notice

For planned surgeries or known upcoming disability:

1. **Maximize your banks:** Work your schedule up to disability
2. **File SDI immediately:** Don't wait
3. **Coordinate with Hartford:** Let them know timeline
4. **Document everything:** Keep meticulous records

### If Unexpected Disability

1. **File SDI as soon as possible**
2. **Report to FedEx immediately**
3. **Check your current bank balances**
4. **Start LTD paperwork early**

### Advanced Income Management

Some pilots have explored strategies to maximize SDI benefits given the complex interaction between sick/vacation pay and SDI income calculations:

- **Using vacation vs. sick time**: Different types of paid time off may be evaluated differently by EDD for income calculation purposes. Confirm current EDD policy before relying on this.
- **Timing sick bank usage**: Using available sick time earlier in a calendar year (before needing SDI) may affect how your income appears during an SDI claim period.
- **Minimizing overlap**: Using DSA strategically to reduce your income by approximately the SDI benefit amount might optimize total compensation, though this requires careful calculation.

::callout{type="warning" title="Verify Before Acting"}
These strategies involve complex interactions between FedEx policies and CA EDD rules. Contact EDD directly to understand current policy before making decisions based on these considerations. What works in one situation may not work in another.

## Bank Payouts

### If You Return to Work

- Sick banks remain for future use
- SDI stops when you return
- No LTD if you return before it starts

### If You Don't Return

- Banks may pay out (check your contract)
- LTD continues per policy
- SDI continues up to 52 weeks

## Practical Tips

### Before Disability

- [ ] Know your current sick bank balance
- [ ] Know your current DSA balance
- [ ] Calculate how long they'll last
- [ ] Understand transition to LTD

### During Disability

- [ ] Track your bank usage
- [ ] Estimate exhaustion date
- [ ] File SDI early
- [ ] Start LTD paperwork before banks run out

### Transition Period

- [ ] Know exactly when banks will exhaust
- [ ] Confirm LTD start date with Hartford
- [ ] Verify SDI payments are coming
- [ ] Monitor for gaps in coverage

## Common Questions

### Can I use sick bank and receive SDI?

It depends on timing and how FedEx reports your wages. Generally:
- SDI pays for periods you're not receiving regular wages
- If sick bank is paying you, SDI may be reduced or delayed
- Consult EDD for specifics

### How does EDD evaluate my income during disability?

CA EDD evaluates whether you are earning less than you would have if you were not disabled. This can be complex with pilot pay structures. Key considerations:

- **Sick Pay**: According to EDD guidance, sick pay generally counts as income when evaluating your earnings.
- **Vacation Pay**: Vacation pay may be treated differently than sick pay for SDI purposes. Contact EDD for current policy.
- **Gap Periods**: If there is a gap between when you called in sick and your first duty period, an EDD representative may suggest categorizing that period in a way that supports your claim (such as "part-time" status even though FedEx doesn't have part-time pilots). This is simply a categorization for benefit purposes.

The way information is presented to EDD can affect your benefit eligibility and amount. Accurate, complete information is essential.

### Should I exhaust banks before filing SDI?

**No.** File SDI as soon as you're disabled. The 49-day deadline runs from disability start, not from when banks run out. Filing late can mean losing weeks of benefits.

### What if my banks run out before SDI is approved?

This is exactly the problem this guide helps you avoid. Strategies:
- File SDI immediately when disabled
- Follow up proactively on your claim
- Have emergency savings if possible
- Contact ALPA if in financial hardship
