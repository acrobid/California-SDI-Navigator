# Sick Bank Strategy

Understanding how to manage your sick banks is crucial for both short-term protection and long-term disability planning.

## Understanding Your Banks

### Regular Sick Bank

- Accrues continuously during employment
- Used for short-term illness
- May have maximum accrual limits

### Disability Sick Absence (DSA) Bank

- Specifically for extended disability periods
- May have different accrual rules
- Often used before LTD kicks in

## The Transition Timeline

```
Phase 1: Sick Bank
↓ (when exhausted)
Phase 2: DSA Bank  
↓ (when exhausted)
Phase 3: LTD Benefits (with SDI offset)
```

You can file for CA SDI during any phase when you're unable to work. You don't have to wait until sick banks are exhausted. In fact, filing early is recommended.

## SDI Filing Timing

### Early Filing Benefits

- Claim processing starts sooner
- Payments may begin when you need them
- 49-day deadline doesn't become a crisis
- More time to resolve any issues

### When SDI Payments Actually Start

SDI has a **7-day waiting period** (no benefits paid for first 7 days of disability). After that:

- If approved, payments begin for the period after the waiting period
- Payments may overlap with or replace sick bank pay
- Coordination depends on timing

## The Hartford Offset Consideration

::callout{type="warning" title="Key Decision Point"}
The Hartford offset only applies to LTD benefits. While you're still using sick banks, there's no LTD to offset.
::

### Optimal Timing Strategy

1. **File SDI early** in your disability
2. **Use sick/DSA banks** while SDI processes
3. **SDI payments begin** (hopefully before LTD starts)
4. **LTD begins** when sick banks exhausted
5. **Offset applies** but you're already receiving SDI

The goal is to have SDI approved and paying **before** you transition to LTD, minimizing the gap where Hartford offsets SDI you haven't received.

## Checking Your Balances

### Where to Find Your Balances

1. **Workday:** Check current balances
2. **Pay stubs:** Often show current accruals
3. **HR:** Can provide historical information

### What to Document

- Current sick bank balance (hours)
- Current DSA bank balance (hours)
- Monthly accrual rate
- Any caps or limits

## Estimating Duration

Calculate how long your banks will last:

```
Total Sick Hours ÷ Monthly Usage Rate = Months of Coverage

Example:
- Sick bank: 480 hours
- DSA bank: 720 hours
- Total: 1,200 hours
- Monthly burn: 168 hours (full month)
- Duration: ~7 months
```

## Strategic Considerations

### If You Have Advance Notice

For planned surgeries or known upcoming disability:

1. **Maximize your banks:** Work your schedule up to disability
2. **File SDI immediately:** Don't wait
3. **Coordinate with Hartford:** Let them know timeline
4. **Document everything:** Keep meticulous records

### If Unexpected Disability

1. **File SDI as soon as possible**
2. **Report to FedEx immediately**
3. **Check your current bank balances**
4. **Start LTD paperwork early**

## Bank Payouts

### If You Return to Work

- Sick banks remain for future use
- SDI stops when you return
- No LTD if you return before it starts

### If You Don't Return

- Banks may pay out (check your contract)
- LTD continues per policy
- SDI continues up to 52 weeks

## Practical Tips

### Before Disability

- [ ] Know your current sick bank balance
- [ ] Know your current DSA balance
- [ ] Calculate how long they'll last
- [ ] Understand transition to LTD

### During Disability

- [ ] Track your bank usage
- [ ] Estimate exhaustion date
- [ ] File SDI early
- [ ] Start LTD paperwork before banks run out

### Transition Period

- [ ] Know exactly when banks will exhaust
- [ ] Confirm LTD start date with Hartford
- [ ] Verify SDI payments are coming
- [ ] Monitor for gaps in coverage

## Common Questions

### Can I use sick bank and receive SDI?

It depends on timing and how FedEx reports your wages. Generally:
- SDI pays for periods you're not receiving regular wages
- If sick bank is paying you, SDI may be reduced or delayed
- Consult EDD for specifics

### Should I exhaust banks before filing SDI?

**No.** File SDI as soon as you're disabled. The 49-day deadline runs from disability start, not from when banks run out. Filing late can mean losing weeks of benefits.

### What if my banks run out before SDI is approved?

This is exactly the problem this guide helps you avoid. Strategies:
- File SDI immediately when disabled
- Follow up proactively on your claim
- Have emergency savings if possible
- Contact ALPA if in financial hardship
