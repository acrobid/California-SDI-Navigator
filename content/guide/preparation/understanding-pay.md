# Understanding Your Pay Structure

One of the biggest challenges in filing a CA SDI claim as a FedEx pilot is that the EDD system was not designed for airline pilot compensation. Understanding how to translate your pay is critical.

## Pilot Pay vs. Traditional Pay

### What EDD Expects

EDD's systems are designed for employees with:

- Fixed monthly or bi-weekly salaries
- Consistent hours each pay period
- Simple pay categories (regular pay, overtime, bonus)
- Clear distinction between sick pay and regular pay

### What Pilots Have

FedEx pilots have:

- Variable monthly income based on flying
- Multiple pay components each pay period
- Per diem that isn't really "income"
- Sick pay that looks identical to flight pay on statements
- Semi-monthly pay periods (twice monthly)

## Pay Components Explained

### Flight Pay (Trip Pay)

This is your primary compensation—pay for actual flight hours flown.

- Varies month to month based on your schedule
- Calculated based on credit hours × hourly rate
- This is "regular work pay" in EDD terms

### Per Diem

Compensation for meals and incidentals while traveling.

- Not technically "wages" in the traditional sense
- FedEx pay stubs show this as non-taxable income
- Does NOT count toward SDI benefit calculations

### Premium Pay / Override / Night Differential

Additional compensation for specific situations:

- Holiday pay
- Override pay
- Night operations differential
- Training pay
- **These are taxable wages** and should be included in your calculations.

### Sick Pay

::callout{type="warning" title="The Sick Pay Problem"}
On FedEx pay stubs, sick pay often appears listed as "Regular Pay" on the summary line. This is a major issue when proving to EDD that you were NOT working during periods you were on sick leave.

### Vacation Pay

Pay for vacation days used. Similar to sick pay in appearance.

## Pilot-Specific Pay Mapping

| Pilot Reality                   | EDD Assumption       | Friction                               |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Semi-monthly pay                | Monthly or bi-weekly | Calculation confusion                  |
| Variable hours per month        | Consistent schedule  | "Regular" pay undefined                |
| Per diem (non-taxable)          | All pay is wages     | Confuses total income figures          |
| Trip pay, override, premium     | Simple hourly/salary | Multiple line items confuse processors |
| Sick pay looks like regular pay | Clear distinction    | Hard to prove work stopped             |
| Schedule varies (not M-F)       | Daily work expected  | "Last day worked" can be ambiguous     |

## Monthly Equivalent Calculation

EDD often needs monthly income figures. FedEx pays semi-monthly (twice per month), so:

```
Monthly Income = (Semi-Monthly Pay Period 1) + (Semi-Monthly Pay Period 2)
```

For the "highest quarter" calculation:

```
Quarterly Income = Month 1 + Month 2 + Month 3
```

## Your Base Period

SDI benefits are calculated based on your "base period"—a specific 12-month window:

| If You File In | Your Base Period Used            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Jan - Mar      | Oct (2 yrs ago) - Sep (1 yr ago) |
| Apr - Jun      | Jan - Dec (previous year)        |
| Jul - Sep      | Apr (last yr) - Mar (this yr)    |
| Oct - Dec      | Jul (last yr) - Jun (this yr)    |

::callout{type="tip" title="Timing Matters"}
If you're close to a quarter boundary and can control your filing date, calculate which base period gives you a higher benefit. Even a few days difference in filing can change your base period.

## Recommended Action: Pay Explanation Letter

Because pilots have such complex pay, we strongly suggest submitting a **Pilot Pay Explanation Letter** (see our [Templates](/templates) section). This explains to the EDD processor exactly how to read your stubs and why your last day worked might not result in an immediate drop in "pay" (due to sick bank usage).

## What FedEx Reports to EDD

FedEx payroll reports wage data to EDD, but:

- Categories may not match your pay stub detail
- "Regular pay" might include sick pay
- The data FedEx sends may be confusing to EDD
- Some pilots have experienced incorrect or zero reporting

### Verify Your Records

Before filing, consider:

1. Reviewing what data EDD already has about you
2. Gathering your own pay stubs as backup
3. Being prepared to explain pilot compensation

## Tools to Help

### Use the Calculator

Our [Benefit Calculator](/calculator) helps you:

- Input your quarterly income
- See your estimated SDI benefit
- Understand how income translates to benefits

### Gather Documentation

For the [preparation checklist](/checklist):

- Save at least 18 months of pay stubs
- Calculate your highest quarter
- Document which pay represents actual work vs. sick time

## Explaining to EDD

If you need to explain your pay to an EDD representative:

**Key Points:**

1. "I am an airline pilot paid per flight hour, not hourly wages"
2. "My schedule and pay vary month to month"
3. "A full month of work is typically 75-85 flight hours"
4. "Sick pay appears the same as regular pay on my statements"

See the [Pay Stub Translator](/templates) section for tools to create EDD-friendly summaries.
