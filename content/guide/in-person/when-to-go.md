# When to Go In Person to EDD

In-person visits to EDD can be extremely helpful—but also time-consuming. Here's when it's worth it.

## Good Reasons to Go In Person

### Your Claim Is Stuck

**Signs your claim is stuck:**

- No status change for 3+ weeks
- Online status says "Pending" for too long
- You've called multiple times without resolution

**Why in-person helps:**

- Direct access to a representative
- Can review your file on the spot
- Often resolves issues that phone cannot

### Your Situation Is Complex

**Complex situations include:**

- Unusual pay structure (pilots qualify!)
- Multiple employers during base period
- Previous denied claim
- Conflicting information in system

**Why in-person helps:**

- Can explain details directly
- Provide documentation immediately
- Representative can notate file

### You Need Immediate Resolution

**Time-sensitive situations:**

- Approaching 49-day deadline
- Urgent financial need
- Document requests with short deadlines

**Why in-person helps:**

- Same-day processing possible
- Can submit documents directly
- Get answers immediately

### Phone Isn't Working

**When phone fails:**

- Can't get through (perpetual hold)
- Keep getting transferred/disconnected
- Phone reps can't help with your issue

**Why in-person helps:**

- Guaranteed to speak to someone
- Higher-level issues can be escalated
- More thorough review possible

## When NOT to Go In Person

### For Routine Status Checks

- Check online instead
- Phone is faster for simple questions
- Save in-person visits for real issues

### When You Just Filed

- Give your claim 2-3 weeks to process
- Initial waiting is normal
- Going too early accomplishes nothing

### If You're Missing Documents

- Get your documents ready first
- Going without what you need wastes time
- Prepare completely before visiting

## What to Expect

### Wait Times

::callout{type="warning" title="Long Waits"}
EDD offices typically have 4-6+ hour wait times. Some pilots report full-day waits. Plan accordingly.
::

**How the system works:**

1. Arrive before office opens
2. Get a numbered ticket when doors open
3. Wait to be called
4. Meet with representative

### The Experience

**Typical visit:**

- Arrive 30-60 minutes before opening
- Line forms outside before doors open
- Limited tickets issued each day
- Bring something to do while waiting
- Plan for 4-6 hours minimum

### What Happens at Your Turn

A representative will:

1. Review your claim on their system
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. Accept any documents you have
4. Make notations in your file
5. Provide guidance on next steps

## Making the Most of Your Visit

### Before You Go

1. **Have clear goals** - Know exactly what you need resolved
2. **Gather all documents** - See [What to Bring](/guide/in-person/what-to-bring)
3. **Prepare a summary** - Written summary of your situation
4. **Check office hours** - Confirm open days/hours
5. **Verify address** - Use the correct office location

### During Your Visit

1. **Be patient** - Long waits are normal
2. **Be polite** - Representatives have hard jobs
3. **Be prepared** - Have everything organized
4. **Take notes** - Write down what you're told
5. **Get names** - Note who you speak with

### After Your Visit

1. **Document everything** - What was discussed, promised, etc.
2. **Follow up if needed** - On any action items
3. **Save any paperwork** - Receipts, printouts, forms

## Alternatives to In-Person

### Before Going In Person, Try:

1. **Online portal** - Many issues can be resolved online
2. **Phone call** - Early morning, be persistent
3. **Fax** - For document submissions
4. **Mail** - For non-urgent items (certified, return receipt)
5. **State Assembly member** - For unresponsive EDD

### Assembly Member Option

Your state Assembly member has an EDD liaison who can:

- Contact EDD on your behalf
- Escalate stuck claims
- Get faster responses

**How to use:**

1. Find your Assembly member at [findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov](https://findyourrep.legislature.ca.gov)
2. Contact their district office
3. Explain you need help with EDD
4. Provide your claim details

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Worth the Trip If:

- Claim stuck for 3+ weeks with no resolution
- Phone has failed multiple times
- Complex situation needing explanation
- Time-sensitive deadline approaching
- You have a full day available

### Not Worth the Trip If:

- Just filed and waiting normally
