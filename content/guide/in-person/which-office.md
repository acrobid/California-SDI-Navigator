# Which EDD Office to Visit

California has multiple EDD offices. Here's how to find the right one.

## Finding Your Local Office

### EDD Office Locator

Use the official EDD office locator:
1. Visit [edd.ca.gov/Office_Locator](https://edd.ca.gov/Office_Locator)
2. Enter your zip code or city
3. Find offices near you
4. Note services offered at each

### Not All Offices Handle SDI

## Key SDI Offices

### Major California Cities

**Los Angeles Area:**
- Los Angeles (Downtown)
- Pasadena
- Inglewood
- Van Nuys

**San Francisco Bay Area:**
- Oakland
- San Francisco
- San Jose
- Fremont

**San Diego Area:**
- San Diego (Main)

**Sacramento Area:**

### Office for FedEx Pilots

**Most Common:**
- Office nearest your home address
- Office nearest your pilot base (if different)
- Oakland and Los Angeles handle high volume

Verify specific office addresses and hours on the [Contacts](/contacts) page or EDD website.

## What to Check Before Going

### 1. Services Offered

Confirm the office handles:
- Disability Insurance (DI/SDI)
- New claims AND existing claims
- Document submission

### 2. Hours of Operation

**Typical hours:**
- Monday-Friday, 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM
- Some offices may have different schedules
- Closed on state holidays

**Best time to arrive:**
- 30-60 minutes before opening
- Tickets issued first-come, first-served
- Afternoons often have fewer tickets remaining

### 3. Current Wait Times

- Call ahead if possible
- Check online reviews for recent experiences
- Be prepared for 4-6+ hour waits regardless

### 4. Parking

- Many offices have limited parking
- Consider public transportation
- Arrive early for parking too

## Remote/Out-of-State Considerations

### If You Live Outside California

Many FedEx pilots don't live in California but are based there.

**Your options:**
1. **Online filing** - From anywhere
2. **Mail filing** - From anywhere
3. **Phone** - From anywhere
4. **In-person** - When you're in California

::callout{type="info" title="Planning Ahead"}
If you anticipate going on disability, consider scheduling an in-person visit during a trip to California.

### Closest Office to Your Base

| FedEx Base | Nearest Major EDD Office |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Oakland (OAK) | Oakland EDD |
| Los Angeles (LAX) | Los Angeles/Inglewood EDD |
| Ontario (ONT) | San Bernardino EDD |
| San Francisco (SFO) | Oakland/San Francisco EDD |

## What to Look For in an Office

### Higher Volume = More Experience

Larger offices often:
- Have more experienced staff
- Handle unusual situations better
- Understand complex pay structures

### Pilot-Specific Experience

Some offices may have staff who:
- Have helped pilots before
- Understand variable pay
- Know the SDI/LTD interaction

Unfortunately, there's no way to guarantee this—but larger metro offices are your best bet.

## Alternative: Appointments

### Scheduling an Appointment

Some offices offer appointments:
1. Check EDD website for availability
2. Call the office directly
3. Use online appointment scheduler if available

**Benefits of appointments:**
- Scheduled time (less waiting)
- More focused assistance
- Better for complex issues

**Drawbacks:**
- Limited availability
- May still have some wait
- Not always available

## Tips for Choosing an Office

### If You Have Options:

1. **Closest to home/base** - Convenience matters
2. **Largest office** - More staff, more experience
3. **Best reviews** - Check online for recent experiences
4. **Appointment availability** - If offered, consider it

### If You Only Have One Option:

1. Verify it handles SDI
2. Check hours and plan to arrive early
3. Prepare thoroughly
4. Be ready for a long day

## Virtual Options

### Before Making the Trip

Consider whether virtual options can solve your issue:

| Need | Virtual Option |
|------|---------------|
| Status check | Online portal |
| Simple question | Phone (if you can get through) |
| Document submission | Online upload or fax |
| Complex issue | In-person likely needed |
| Stuck claim | In-person or Assembly member |
