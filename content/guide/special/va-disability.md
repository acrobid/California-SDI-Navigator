# VA Disability and SDI/LTD

Many pilots are veterans with VA disability ratings. Here's how VA benefits interact with California SDI and Hartford LTD.

## VA Disability and CA SDI

### Good News: No SDI Offset

::callout{type="tip" title="SDI Does NOT Offset VA Disability"}
California SDI does **not** reduce or offset for VA disability compensation. You can receive both simultaneously without reduction.
::

**You receive:**

- Full VA disability compensation, AND
- Full SDI benefits (if otherwise eligible)

**No coordination required:**

- Don't need to report VA disability to EDD
- VA compensation doesn't affect SDI eligibility
- SDI amount is not reduced by VA payments

## VA Disability and Hartford LTD

### Potential Offset

Hartford's LTD policy may or may not offset for VA disability. Check your specific policy.

**Typically:**

- Service-connected VA disability: Usually **NOT offset**
- VA pension (non-service connected): May be offset
- Other VA benefits: Varies by policy

::callout{type="warning" title="Review Your Policy"}
Hartford policies vary. Request and review your specific LTD policy to understand offset provisions for VA benefits.
::

### What to Do

1. **Review policy** - Check offset provisions carefully
2. **Keep benefits separate** - Don't volunteer information not requested
3. **If asked** - Distinguish service-connected from other VA benefits
4. **If offset applied** - May be grounds for appeal if improper

## Disability Rating Considerations

### If You Have a VA Rating

**For SDI:**

- VA rating doesn't prevent SDI eligibility
- SDI is based on work inability, not VA rating
- Can have 100% VA rating and still qualify for SDI (different criteria)

**For Hartford:**

- "Disabled" for VA is different from "disabled" for LTD
- Hartford uses policy definition, not VA definition
- VA rating is evidence but not determinative

### New VA Claim While on SDI/LTD

If you're filing a new VA claim while on SDI/LTD:

- SDI: No impact, no need to report
- LTD: May need to report (check policy), but service-connected usually not offset

## Social Security Disability (SSDI)

### Different from VA Disability

Don't confuse VA disability with Social Security Disability:

| Benefit                           | Offset SDI? | Offset LTD? |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| VA Disability (service-connected) | No          | Usually No  |
| Social Security Disability (SSDI) | No          | Yes         |
| VA Pension (non-service)          | No          | Possibly    |

### If Filing for SSDI

Many long-term disabilities lead to SSDI applications:

- SSDI **is** offset by Hartford LTD
- Consider timing of SSDI application
- Consult with disability attorney if considering SSDI

## Coordination Strategies

### Maximizing Benefits

**Legal and Appropriate:**

1. Receive full VA disability compensation (always)
2. Apply for and receive full SDI (if eligible)
3. Receive LTD (offset by SDI, but not VA)

**Your Total:**

- VA Disability: Full amount
- SDI: Full amount
- LTD: Reduced by SDI (but not VA)

### Example Calculation

**Assumptions:**

- VA disability: $2,000/month
- SDI: $7,000/month
- LTD (gross): $19,446/month

**Without LTD Offset for VA:**

```
VA:  $2,000/month (unchanged)
SDI: $7,000/month (unchanged)
LTD: $19,446 - $7,000 = $12,446/month

Total: $2,000 + $7,000 + $12,446 = $21,446/month
```

This is better than if LTD offset for VA benefits too.

## Documentation

### Keep Records Of:

- VA rating decision letters
- VA payment amounts
- Distinction between service-connected and other VA benefits
- Any correspondence about VA benefits with Hartford

### If Hartford Asks:

- Provide information required by policy
- Clarify which benefits are service-connected
- Challenge improper offsets if applied

## Common Questions

### "Will Getting SDI Affect My VA Benefits?"

No. VA disability compensation is completely independent of SDI.

### "Do I Need to Report SDI to the VA?"

Generally no, unless you're receiving need-based VA benefits (rare for pilots with VA disability).

### "Can I Work Part-Time with Both?"

Complex question. Working may affect:

- SDI (you must be "unable to do your regular work")
- LTD (definition of "disabled" in policy)
- VA usually not affected by earnings unless pension-based

### "What if I Return to Flying?"

If you return to flying:

- SDI and LTD would stop (no longer disabled)
- VA disability continues (if condition persists)
- VA rating may be reviewed at scheduled intervals
