# SDI for Out-of-State Residents

Many FedEx pilots are based in California but live elsewhere. Here's how SDI works for you.

## Eligibility for Non-Residents

### The Key Question: Where Are You Taxed?

California SDI is funded by employee payroll deductions. If you pay CA SDI tax, you're potentially eligible for CA SDI benefits.

**You likely pay CA SDI tax if:**

- Your pilot base is in California
- Your work is localized in California
- FedEx withholds CA SDI from your pay

**Check your pay stub for:**

- **CA OASDI/E** line item (this is the standard FedEx label for CA SDI)
- State tax withholding for California

### Living Out of State

::callout{type="info" title="Residency Not Required"}
You do NOT need to live in California to receive CA SDI benefits. Eligibility is based on where you work (are taxed), not where you live.
::

## Filing from Out of State

### Initial Claim: Paper Form Required

::callout{type="warning" title="No California ID? File by Mail"}
If you do not have a **California Driver's License** or **California ID card**, you cannot register for an online account for your initial claim. You must file using the paper **DE 2501** form via U.S. Mail.
::

**How to get the paper form:**

1. Order it online from the [EDD Forms and Publications](https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/Forms_and_Publications/) page.
2. Call the EDD at 1-800-480-3287 to request one.
3. Visit an EDD office in person if you are in California for a trip.

### Future Online Access

Once your initial paper claim is processed, the EDD will mail you an **EDD Customer Account Number (EDDCAN)**. You can then use this number to register for an online account, which allows you to manage the rest of your claim and any future claims online.

### Identity Verification (ID.me)

While the newer **ID.me** system used by myEDD accepts out-of-state IDs, the secondary registration step for **SDI Online** specifically requires a California-issued ID number or an existing EDDCAN. This is a common point of frustration for out-of-state pilots.

## Mailing Address Considerations

**For Correspondence:**

- Use your actual home address.
- EDD will mail the DE 2501 form and all correspondence there.
- **Crucial:** Ensure you check your mail daily, as many EDD deadlines are based on the postmark date and are often very short (e.g., 2 days to respond).

**For Residency Questions:**

- Your address doesn't affect eligibility.
- Your base (taxing jurisdiction) determines eligibility.
- If asked, explain that you are a pilot based in California paying CA SDI tax.

### Phone Options

Same as California residents:

- Call EDD at normal numbers
- May have long hold times
- No difference for out-of-state callers

## Special Considerations

### Doctor Requirements

Your treating doctor does NOT need to be in California.

**Acceptable:**

- Any licensed physician
- License verified through state medical board
- Out-of-state doctors are fine

**What EDD Verifies:**

- Doctor has valid medical license
- License is in good standing
- Doctor is qualified to certify disability

### In-Person Visits

If in-person visits are needed:

**Options:**

- Plan around trips to California
- Visit when you're in town for work
- Use phone/online when possible

**If You Must Go:**

- See [Which Office to Visit](/guide/in-person/which-office)
- Oakland and LAX-area offices are common for pilots
- Combine with planned California travel if possible

### Banking and Payments

**Direct Deposit:**

- Works to any US bank account
- No California bank required
- Set up during claim filing

**EDD Debit Card:**

- Mailed to your address
- Works nationwide
- Can withdraw from any ATM

## Tax Implications

### SDI Benefits

SDI benefits are:

- **Not taxable** by California
- **Partially taxable** by federal government in some cases
- Subject to your home state's rules

### Your Home State

Check with your home state regarding:

- Whether they tax SDI benefits
- Any credits for taxes paid to California
- Reporting requirements

## Common Issues for Out-of-State Filers

### Address Questions

**If EDD Questions Your Address:**

- Explain you're a pilot based in California
- Show California SDI tax withholding
- Provide employer location confirmation

### Phone Number Issues

**If Your Phone Area Code Isn't California:**

- Not a problem
- EDD can call any US number
- Ensure voicemail is set up for calls

### Documentation

**Keep These Accessible:**

- Pay stubs showing CA SDI deduction
- W-2 showing California employment
- FedEx employment verification

## Multi-State Considerations

### If You Changed Bases

**Recently Moved FROM California:**

- You may still qualify based on base period earnings
- Check when your CA taxed earnings occurred
- File if you had CA SDI withheld during base period

**Recently Moved TO California:**

- Need CA SDI withholding during base period
- Previous state's disability program may apply
- Check both states' rules

### Working Multiple States

**If You Flew from Multiple Bases:**

- SDI eligibility based on primary base
- Where taxes were withheld matters
- Complex situations may need EDD clarification

## Tips for Out-of-State Pilots

### Be Proactive

1. **Verify coverage** - Check pay stub for CA SDI deductions
2. **Keep records** - Save pay stubs showing CA taxes
3. **Plan for visits** - If in-person needed, combine with travel
4. **Use online tools** - Most processes work remotely

### Communication

- Keep phone and email updated with EDD
- Respond promptly to correspondence
- Check mail regularly (EDD uses postal mail)

### Emergency Contacts

If you can't access mail:

- Set up mail forwarding
- Authorize someone to receive mail
- Check EDD portal for electronic notices
