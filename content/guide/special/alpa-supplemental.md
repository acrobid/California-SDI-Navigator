# ALPA Supplemental Disability Plan

Many pilots carry supplemental disability coverage through ALPA in addition to the FedEx LTD Plan. Understanding how these plans interact is important for maximizing your benefits.

## Two Separate Plans

### FedEx LTD Plan

**Employer-sponsored:**
- Provided through FedEx
- Coverage defined in CBA
- Premium paid by employer
- Claims administered by third party (Aetna or Hartford)
- Subject to CBA terms

### ALPA Disability Insurance

**Union-sponsored:**
- Optional coverage through ALPA
- Premium paid by pilot
- Various coverage levels available
- Separate claims administrator
- Subject to ALPA plan terms

::callout{type="info" title="Independent Coverage"}
These are two completely separate insurance policies with different eligibility rules, benefit amounts, and claims processes.

## Benefits of Supplemental Coverage

### Why Pilots Buy Supplemental Insurance

**Gaps in FedEx LTD:**

1. **Income replacement limit**
   - FedEx LTD capped at 60%/50% of earnings
   - 401(a)(17) limit may reduce benefit for high earners
   - Supplemental insurance can fill the gap

2. **Mental health duration limits**
   - FedEx LTD: 60-month maximum
   - Some supplemental plans: Different or no limits

3. **Taxability**
   - FedEx LTD: Taxable (employer-paid premium)
   - Supplemental: Non-taxable (pilot-paid premium)

4. **Own-occupation definition**
   - FedEx LTD: Switches to "any occupation" after 24 months
   - Some supplemental: "Own occupation" for longer period

### Typical Coverage Amounts

**ALPA supplemental options vary:**
- $2,000 - $10,000+ per month
- Based on pilot's income
- Subject to underwriting
- Premium based on age and coverage amount

## Information Sharing (CBA Section 27.J.20)

### When Both Plans Use Same Administrator

**CBA provision:**

If both the FedEx LTD Plan and the ALPA-sponsored disability plan are administered by the same company (currently may be Aetna), you can authorize information sharing.

**Important clarification:**

> "Each plan shall be administered independently... there shall be no collaboration... in claims payment decisions under each plan"

**What this means:**

✅ **Can share:** Medical records and documentation
✅ **Reduces:** Duplicate paperwork requests
✅ **Saves time:** Don't need to submit same documents twice

❌ **Cannot affect:** Approval decisions on either plan
❌ **No guarantee:** Approval on one doesn't mean approval on other
❌ **Independent:** Each plan decides separately

### How to Authorize Information Sharing

**Step 1: Verify same administrator**
- Check FedEx LTD administrator (Aetna or Hartford)
- Check ALPA plan administrator
- Confirm they're the same company

**Step 2: Request authorization form**
- Contact either administrator
- Request "Authorization to Share Information Form"
- May also be called "Inter-Plan Medical Release"

**Step 3: Complete and submit**
- Sign and date form
- Submit to both plans
- Keep copy for your records

**Step 4: Confirm activation**
- Verify with both administrators
- Understand what will be shared
- Know that decisions remain separate

### Benefits of Information Sharing

**For you:**
- Submit medical records once
- Fewer duplicate requests
- Reduced administrative burden
- Faster processing (potentially)

**For administrators:**
- Access to complete medical file
- Reduced costs
- Better coordination of care

**Limitations:**
- Only works if same company administers both
- Must be renewed periodically
- Can be revoked at any time

## Filing Claims on Both Plans

### File Separately

**Each plan requires:**
- Separate claim application
- Own claim number
- Individual correspondence
- Separate appeals process

**Timeline:**
- File both claims at same time if possible
- Don't wait for one to be approved before filing other
- Processing times may differ

### Information to Provide

**Both will ask for:**
- Personal information
- Employment information
- Medical documentation
- Attending physician statement
- Financial information

**Additional questions:**
- "Do you have other disability insurance?" (Answer: Yes)
- "Have you filed with other carriers?" (Answer: Yes)
- Details about the other plan

### Coordination of Benefits

**Neither plan reduces for the other:**
- FedEx LTD doesn't offset ALPA supplemental
- ALPA supplemental doesn't offset FedEx LTD
- You can receive both simultaneously

**But both may reduce for:**
- Social Security Disability
- Workers' compensation
- Other disability income sources

::callout{type="info" title="Additive Benefits"}
Unlike CA SDI which offsets from FedEx LTD, ALPA supplemental coverage typically stacks on top of FedEx LTD.

## Different Definitions and Criteria

### Why One May Approve and Other Deny

**Each plan has its own:**

1. **Definition of disability**
   - Own occupation vs. any occupation
   - When the standard changes
   - What restrictions qualify

2. **Medical evidence requirements**
   - Types of tests needed
   - Specialist requirements
   - Documentation standards

3. **Waiting periods**
   - Elimination periods may differ
   - When benefits begin

4. **Coverage duration**
   - Maximum benefit periods
   - Condition-specific limits

**Possible outcomes:**

| FedEx LTD | ALPA Supplemental | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Approved | Approved | Most common if both requirements met |
| Approved | Denied | Supplemental has stricter definition |
| Denied | Approved | Rare, but possible with different criteria |
| Denied | Denied | Don't meet either plan's definition |

### If One Approves and Other Denies

**You can:**
- Appeal the denial independently
- Provide additional evidence
- Use approval from one as supporting evidence for other
- But decisions remain independent

**Don't assume:**
- Approval on one guarantees approval on other
- Denial on one means other will deny
- Same criteria apply to both

---

## Managing Multiple Claims

### Organization is Critical

**Create separate files:**

| FedEx LTD File | ALPA Supplemental File |
|----------------|------------------------|
| FedEx claim forms | ALPA claim forms |
| FedEx correspondence | ALPA correspondence |
| FedEx payment records | ALPA payment records |
| FedEx appeal info | ALPA appeal info |

**Shared documents:**
- Medical records (copies in both)
- Test results (copies in both)
- Doctor's statements (copies in both)

### Communication Log

**Track separately:**
- Date and time of contact
- Which plan (FedEx or ALPA)
- Person contacted
- Topic discussed
- Follow-up needed
- Confirmation numbers

### Document Submission

**Best practice:**
- Send documents to both plans separately
- Don't assume information sharing means automatic sharing
- Confirm receipt with both plans
- Note in your log what was sent where

## Premium Payments During Disability

### FedEx LTD

**No premium:**
- Employer-paid
- Nothing to maintain

### ALPA Supplemental

**Pilot-paid premium:**
- Must continue premium payments
- Even while disabled
- Even while collecting benefits
- Coverage lapses if premium not paid

**Waiver of premium:**
- Some policies include this benefit
- Premiums waived after certain period on disability
- Check your specific policy
- Usually requires 90-180 days of disability

**Important:**
- Verify waiver provisions in your policy
- Submit waiver claim if applicable
- Maintain payments until waiver approved
- Don't let policy lapse

---

## Tax Implications

### FedEx LTD Benefits

**Taxable income:**
- Federal income tax applies
- State income tax applies (if your state has it)
- Because employer paid premium
- Reported on W-2 or 1099

### ALPA Supplemental Benefits

**Non-taxable (usually):**
- If you paid premium with after-tax dollars
- Not reported as income
- No tax withholding
- Check your specific policy

**Why this matters:**
- $5,000/month taxable = ~$3,750 after tax (25% bracket)
- $5,000/month non-taxable = $5,000 in your pocket
- Supplemental provides more net income per dollar

## Common Questions

### Q: Should I buy ALPA supplemental coverage?

**Consider if:**
- You want income replacement above 60%
- You're a high earner near 401(a)(17) cap

- You want longer own-occupation coverage

**May not need if:**
- You have adequate savings
- You have other disability insurance
- Premium cost is prohibitive
- You're close to retirement

### Q: When should I buy it?

**Best time:**
- Early in career when younger and healthier
- Before any medical conditions develop
- When premiums are lowest
- While you can pass underwriting

### Q: Can I buy it while on disability?

**Generally no:**
- Must be actively working
- Must pass medical underwriting
- Pre-existing conditions excluded
- Buy before you need it

### Q: How much coverage should I get?

**Calculation:**
```
Monthly income:           $15,000
FedEx LTD (60%):         $9,000
Desired replacement:      $12,000 (80%)
Gap:                      $3,000

Consider: $3,000-4,000/month supplemental
```

**Balance:**
- Coverage needed
- Premium cost
- Other resources
- Risk tolerance
