# Returning to Work

When you're ready to return to flying, there are important steps to properly close out your disability benefits.

## Before Returning to Work

### Medical Clearance

**FAA Medical:**

- You need a valid FAA medical certificate
- May require special issuance depending on condition
- Work with your AME (Aviation Medical Examiner)
- Allow time for medical processing

**Company Clearance:**

- FedEx medical may have additional requirements
- Flight operations clearance needed
- Training currency requirements

::callout{type="warning" title="Don't Rush It"}
Ensure you're fully medically cleared before returning. Returning too soon can result in re-injury and complications.
::

### Benefits Coordination

**Understand the Timing:**

- SDI stops when you return to work
- LTD stops when you return to work
- Some partial work arrangements exist

## Notifying EDD (SDI)

### When to Notify

Notify EDD **before or immediately when** you return to work:

1. **Certifications will ask** - If you're certifying, you'll report this
2. **Stop certifying** - Don't certify for periods you're working
3. **Call if needed** - For questions about closing your claim

### How to Notify

**If You're Still Certifying:**

- On your certification, indicate you returned to work
- Provide the return date
- Answer all questions honestly

**To Officially Close:**

- Call EDD if needed: 1-800-480-3287
- Or send written notification

### Overpayment Risk

::callout{type="danger" title="Avoid Overpayments"}
If you receive SDI payments after returning to work, you'll owe that money back. Report your return promptly.
::

## Notifying Hartford (LTD)

### When to Notify

Notify Hartford **before or immediately when** you return to work:

- Call your claims representative
- Provide return date
- Confirm final payment details

### Hartford Contact

- Phone: 1-888-563-1124
- Have your claim number ready
- Get confirmation in writing

### Final LTD Payment

Hartford will:

- Prorate your final payment
- Issue payment through last day of disability
- Close your claim

## Transition Scenarios

### Full Return to Flying

**Most Common:**

- Clear medically (FAA and company)
- Return to full flying duties
- All disability benefits stop

### Partial or Gradual Return

**If Applicable:**

- Some conditions allow gradual return
- SDI has limited provisions for partial disability
- LTD may have rehabilitation provisions
- Discuss with both EDD and Hartford

### Returning but Not Fully Recovered

**Complex Situation:**

- May still have some limitations
- Could affect future claims if you go out again
- Document everything carefully

## Financial Planning

### Timeline Considerations

```
Week -4:     Begin FAA medical process
Week -2:     Company clearance process
Week -1:     Notify Hartford of expected return
Day 0:       Return to work
Day 1-3:     Stop SDI certifications
Day 7:       Confirm benefits stopped correctly
Day 30:      Verify no erroneous payments
```

### Cash Flow Impact

**When Returns:**

- Last SDI payment: Covers through last day of disability
- First paycheck: After you've worked and been paid
- Gap possible: Plan for this

**Example:**

```
Last day disabled:     June 15
First day working:     June 16
Last SDI payment:      Covers through June 15
First paycheck:        July 1 (for June 16-30 work)
```

### Tax Considerations

**For Tax Year:**

- SDI (generally not taxable in CA)
- LTD (taxable as income)
- W-2 income (fully taxable)
- Consult tax professional for your situation

## If You Become Disabled Again

### New Disability

If you become disabled again after returning:

- May file a new SDI claim
- New 49-day deadline from new disability date
- New Hartford claim may be needed
- Pre-existing condition provisions may apply

### Same Disability

If the same condition recurs:

- May be considered same or new claim depending on time
- Discuss with EDD and Hartford
- Keep all medical records

## Documentation

### Keep These Records

Even after returning, maintain records of:

- All disability payments received
- Medical records during disability
- Return to work date
- Medical clearance documents
- Final claim correspondence

### For Future Reference

Records may be needed for:

- Tax purposes
- Future disability claims

## Returning Part-Time

### SDI and Part-Time Work

- Generally, SDI is for full disability
- Part-time work may affect benefits
- Report all work to EDD

### LTD and Part-Time Work

Hartford may have:

- Rehabilitation provisions
- Partial disability benefits

Check your policy and discuss with your claims representative.
